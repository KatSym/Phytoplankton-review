Using data from the world's longest-running shallow lake experimental mesocosm facility, we studied the effects of different levels of nutrient loadings combined with varying temperatures, which also included a simulated 1-month summer heat wave (HW), on nutrient and oxygen concentrations, gross ecosystem primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), net ecosystem production (NEP) and bacterioplankton production (BACPR). The mesocosms had two nutrient levels (high (HN) and low (LN)) combined with three different temperatures according to the IPCC 2007 warming scenarios (unheated, A2 and A2 + 50%) that were applied for 11 years prior to the present experiment. The simulated HW consisted of 5 degrees C extra temperature increases only in the A2 and A2 + 50% treatments applied from 1 July to 1 August 2014. Linear mixed effect modeling revealed a strong effect of nutrient treatment on the concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl-a), on various forms of phosphorus and nitrogen as well as on oxygen concentration and oxygen percentage (24 h means). Applying the full dataset, we also found a significant positive effect of nutrient loading on GPP, ER, NEP and BACPR, and of temperature on ER and BACPR. The HW had a significant positive effect on GPP and ER. When dividing the data into LN and HN, temperature also had a significant positive effect on Chl-a in LN and on orthophosphate in HN. Linear mixed models revealed differential effects of nutrients, Chl-a and macrophyte abundance (PVI) on the metabolism variables, with PVI being particularly important in the LN mesocosms. All metabolism variables also responded strongly to a cooling-low irradiance event in the middle of the HW, resulting in a severe drop in oxygen concentrations, not least in the HN heated mesocosms. Our results demonstrate strong effects of nutrients as well as an overall rapid response in oxygen metabolism and BACPR to changes in temperature, including HWs, making them sensitive ecosystem indicators of climate warming.",10.3390/w13020127,shallow lake,Denmark,56.2333,9.5167,No,No,2014-06-16,2014-08-16,,2800,Outdoor,No,4,eutrophic,nutrient treatments (low (LN) and high (HN)),Yes,HN weekly additions: 7 mg P m² d⁻¹ and 27.1 mg N m² d⁻¹,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,"NP But, sources provided: Meehl, G.A.

In the A2 scenario, only picoalgae responded to nutrients, while in the A2+ scenario all but the heterotrophic nanoflagellates showed a response. Elevated winter temperatures seemed not to be more important for the microbial assemblage than elevated summer temperatures.

The timing of the spring bloom was advanced both by warming and higher light intensity, but the influence of temperature on the phytoplankton community was stronger than the light effect. Warming affected phytoplankton directly and indirectly via enhanced grazing pressure at higher temperatures. Warming resulted in markedly lower phytoplankton biomass and a shift towards smaller cell sizes. It also led to changes in the community structure of phytoplankton and zooplankton. Among phytoplankton, large-celled diatoms were most negatively affected by warming. Overwintering zooplankton species (Oithona, Pseudocalanus) remained dominant in the cold treatments, while they were replaced by late spring or summer species (Acartia, Centropages, Temora) in the warmed treatments.

However, few studies have investigated this combined effect. Here we tested the effects of warming (elevated 3celcius) and cDOM input (three levels of humic river water addition) on GPP in autumn (2 months including open water and ice-covered periods) in experimental pond ecosystems. The cDOM input decreased whole-ecosystem GPP at natural temperature conditions mainly as a result of lower benthic GPP not fully counteracted by an increase in pelagic GPP, while warming increased whole-ecosystem GPP due to a positive response of mainly pelagic GPP at all levels of cDOM input. Warming delayed autumn ice cover formation by 2 weeks but did not affect light availability in the water column compared to ambient ice-covered treatments. Gross primary production during this period was still affected by warming and cDOM. The results stress the importance of accounting for multiple climate drivers and habitats when predicting lake GPP responses to climate change.

Globally, lakes are warming and browning with ongoing climate change. These changes significantly impact a lake's biogeochemical properties and all organisms, including invertebrate consumers. The effects of these changes are essential to understand, especially during critical periods after and before the growing season, that is, autumn and spring, which can determine the composition of the invertebrate consumer community.2. In this study, we used a large -scale experimental pond system to test the combined effect of warming (+3 degrees C) and increased input of terrestrial and coloured dissolved organic carbon (gradient of 1.6- 8.8 mg/L in the ambient and 1.6- 9.3 mg/L in the warm)- which causes browning- on zooplankton and benthic macroinvertebrate biomass and composition during the autumn and the following spring.3. Total zooplankton biomass decreased with warming and increased with browning, while total zoobenthos did not respond to either treatment. Warming and browning throughout the autumn had no overall interactive effects on zooplankton or zoobenthos. Autumnal warming decreased total pelagic consumer biomass, caused by a decrease in both Rotifera and Copepoda. In contrast, there was no effect on overall benthic consumer biomass, with only Asellus sp. biomass showing a negative response to warming. An autumnal increase in dissolved organic carbon led to increased total pelagic consumer biomass, which was related to increases in Daphnia sp. biomass but did not affect zoobenthos biomass. While we expected zooplankton and zoobenthos biomass to follow responses in primary and bacterial production to treatments, we did not find any relationship between consumer groups and these estimates of resource production.4. Our results suggest that consumer responses to warming and browning during autumn may lead to less overarching general changes in consumer biomass, and responses are mostly taxon-specific.5.

Little is known regarding the synergistic effects of these phenomena on bacterial communities in oligotrophic marine ecosystems that are expected to be particularly vulnerable. Here, we studied bacterial community composition changes based on 16S rRNA sequencing at two fractions (0.1-0.2 and >0.2 mu m) during a 10- day fully factorial mesocosm experiment in the eastern Mediterranean where the pH decreased by similar to 0.3 units and temperature increased by similar to 3 degrees C to project possible future changes in surface waters. The bacterial community experienced significant taxonomic differences driven by the combined effect of time and treatment; a community shift one day after the manipulations was noticed, followed by a similar state between all mesocosms at the third day, and mild shifts later on, which were remarkable mainly under sole acidification.

The impact of temperature on phyto-bacterioplankton coupling and bacterial community composition (BCC) was the focus of the present study, in which an indoor mesocosm experiment with natural plankton communities from the western Baltic Sea was conducted. A 6 degrees C increase in water temperature resulted, as predicted, in tighter coupling between the diatom-dominated phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria, accompanied by a strong increase in carbon flow into bacterioplankton during the phytoplankton bloom phase. Suppressed bacterial development at cold in situ temperatures probably reflected lowered bacterial production and grazing by protists, as the latter were less affected by low temperatures. BCC was strongly influenced by the phytoplankton bloom stage and to a lesser extent by temperature. Under both temperature regimes, Gammaproteobacteria clearly dominated during the phytoplankton peak, with Glaciecola sp. as the single most abundant taxon. However, warming induced the appearance of additional bacterial taxa belonging to Betaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes.

Strong but opposite pesticide and warming effects on Myriophyllum drove the response of the total macrophyte biomass.

The assemblage was sampled in March 2012 and exposed to the following four treatments for 12 days: control (similar to 360 mu atm, 14 degrees C), elevated pCO(2) (similar to 610 mu atm, 14 degrees C), elevated temperature (similar to 410 mu atm, 17 degrees C), and elevated pCO(2) and temperature (similar to 690 mu atm, 17 degrees C). Nutrients were already depleted at the beginning of the experiment and the concentrations of chlorophyll a (chl a), heterotrophic prokaryotes and viruses decreased, under all treatments, throughout the experiment. There were no statistically significant effects of ocean warming and acidification, whether in isolation or combined, on the concentrations of nutrients, particulate organic matter, chl a and most of the photosynthetic pigments. Furthermore, C-13 labelling showed that the carbon transfer rates from C-13-sodium bicarbonate into particulate organic carbon were not affected by seawater warming nor acidification. Rates of gross primary production followed the general decreasing trend of chl a concentrations and were significantly higher under elevated temperature, an effect exacerbated when combined to elevated pCO(2) level. In contrast to the other algal groups, the picophytoplankton population (cyanobacteria, mostly Synechococcus) increased throughout the experiment and was more abundant in the warmer treatment though to a lesser extent when combined to high pCO(2) level.

Although several experimental studies of lake browning and warming have been conducted over the last decade, knowledge remains limited as to the structural and functional responses of multitrophic plankton communities, especially under environmentally relevant physicochemical conditions. Using reverse osmosis to manipulate naturally occurring dissolved organic matter (DOM), we performed an enclosure experiment to evaluate the response of a planktonic food web (zooplankton-phytoplankton-bacterioplankton) to individual and combined increases in DOM and temperature, while accounting for changes in inorganic nutrients associated with DOM enrichment. We found that concomitant increases in DOM and temperature or inorganic nutrients elicited substantially greater biotic effects, but infrequently led to interactive effects. Overall, major plankton groups responded differently to manipulated factors, with most effects observed in standing stocks, community composition, and trophic structure, while metabolic (primary production and respiration) rates appeared to be generally less responsive. DOM enrichment had a clear stimulatory effect on phytoplankton, but weakly affected zooplankton. More specifically, DOM enrichment, alone or combined with inorganic nutrient amendments, decreased zooplankton : chlorophyll a ratios, implying a reduced trophic transfer efficiency and altered trophic structure. Warming generally increased bacterial abundance and cyanobacterial dominance, especially under DOM-enriched conditions. Collectively, these results demonstrate that increasing local DOM, even by only similar to 2 mgC L-1, can enhance plankton responses to rising temperature or inorganic nutrients in the near-surface layer of a clearwater lake, with potential implications for ecosystems facing co-occurring environmental changes.",10.1002/lno.12177,shallow lake,Canada,45.5333,-73.1333,No,No,2018-07-27,2018-09-25,,1200,In-Situ,No,4,oligo-mesotrophic,,Yes,"To disentangle DOM and inorganic nutrients effects, they incorporated an inorganic nutrient treatment, matching the increased supply in inorganic nutrients from our DOM- enriched treatment.

An experiment was conducted with six 13-m(3) land-based mesocosms (5 m deep) from February to April 1997 to address the impact of increased temperature (+3 degreesC) on growth, survival, and trophic dynamics of winter flounder larvae. Objectives were to determine if warmer winter temperatures result in lower survival of winter flounder as a result of increased predator activity or if temperature-induced alterations in the food web result in greater food availability, perhaps leading to increased survival. Analyses of variance revealed significant (P < 0.05) or near-significant (P < 0.10) differences in phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance and biomass between warm and cool mesocosms. Winter flounder egg survival, percent hatch, time to hatch, and initial size were significantly greater in cool systems (P < 0.05). Mortality rates were lower in cool systems and significantly related to the abundance of active predators (P < 0.05).

In shallow lakes, this may affect primary producers through a number of direct and indirect mechanisms. We conducted a six-month mesocosm experiment to elucidate how periphyton (on inert substrata), epiphyton and epipelon biomass responded to a nitrogen (N) pulse, an approximately tenfold enrichment of the NO3-pool, under three contrasting warming scenarios: ambient temperature and ca. +3A degrees C and ca. +4.5A degrees C elevated temperatures (hereafter T1, T2 and T3). After the N pulse, we found a higher periphyton biomass at elevated than at ambient temperatures but no change in epiphyton biomass. Epipelon biomass was lower in T3 than in T1. Both periphyton and epiphyton biomasses correlated negatively with snail biomass, while epiphyton biomass correlated positively with light. Different responses to higher temperatures under short-term extreme nutrient loading conditions may be attributed to differences in the access to nutrient sources and light.

Ecological stoichiometry provides a conceptual framework that explains this trophic interaction using C, N and P elemental composition across trophic levels. In light of ongoing climate change and eutrophication, previous studies have raised concerns regarding the growing stoichiometric mismatch between phytoplankton and zooplankton, given the stoichiometric plasticity of phytoplankton. However, there is currently little conclusive evidence on the stoichiometric mismatch from a dual perspective of phytoplankton and zooplankton. To address this, we conducted a mesocosm experiment to investigate the separate and combined effects of climate warming (a constant increase of +3.5 ​°C plus heat waves) and eutrophication (nutrient addition) on stoichiometric mismatch between phytoplankton and zooplankton by examining stoichiometric changes in both communities. We observed a growing trend in stoichiometric mismatches when warming or nutrient addition acted individually, which was mediated by the increase in nutrient demand (N, P elements) of zooplankton growth. However, when these stressors acted jointly, the mismatches were reversed. This could be because climate warming and eutrophication combined would lead to changes in species composition, which accordingly reshaped the stoichiometric composition at the community level. These results illustrate the need of stoichiometric mismatches for understanding the implication of global change on trophic interactions and ecosystem functioning, requiring consideration not only of cross-trophic levels but also of compositional changes within communities. © 2023 The Authors",10.1016/j.watbs.2023.100205,shallow lake,China,30.4833,113.2000,Yes,No,2021-04-01,2021-11-01,,2500,Outdoor,Not specified,6,NP,,Yes,Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were added to the nutrient addition treatments (E and WE) at a mass ratio of 10:1 (a molar ratio of 22:1).

Several microorganisms, including virio-, bacterio-, and phytoplankton < 10 µm in size, were monitored daily and analysed using flow cytometry for 19 consecutive days in six mesocosms. Three mesocosms (control) had the same natural water temperature as the lagoon, and the other three were warmed by + 3 °C in relation to the control temperature. The cytometric analyses revealed an unexpected community dominated by picophytoplanktonic cells, including Prochlorococcus-like and Picochlorum-like cells, which had not previously been found in Thau Lagoon. The experimental warming treatment increased the abundances of nanophytoplankton, cyanobacteria, bacteria and viruses during the experiment and triggered earlier blooms of cyanobacteria and picoeukaryotes. Only the abundance of Picochlorum-like cells was significantly reduced under warmer conditions. The growth and grazing rates of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton estimated on days 2 and 8 showed that warming enhanced the growth rates of most phytoplankton groups, while it reduced those of bacteria. Surprisingly, warming decreased grazing on phytoplankton and bacteria at the beginning of the experiment, while during the middle of the experiment it decreased the grazing on prokaryote only but increased it for eukaryotes.

Whereas the removal of zooplanktivorous fish may be useful in attempts to mitigate eutrophication in temperate shallow lakes, it is uncertain whether similar mitigation might be achieved in warmer climates. We compared the responses of zooplankton and phytoplankton communities to climate warming in the presence and absence of fish (Aristichthys nobilis) in a 4-month mesocosm experiment at subtropical temperatures. We hypothesized that 1) fish and phytoplankton would benefit from warming, while zooplankton would suffer in fish-present mesocosms and 2) warming would favor zooplankton growth but reduce phytoplankton biomass in fish-absent mesocosms. Our results showed significant interacting effects of warming and fish presence on both phytoplankton and zooplankton. In mesocosms with fish, biomasses of fish and phytoplankton increased in heated treatments, while biomasses of Daphnia and total zooplankton declined. Warming reduced the proportion of large Daphnia in total zooplankton biomass, and reduced the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio, but increased the ratio of chlorophyll a to total phosphorus, indicating a relaxation of zooplankton grazing pressure on phytoplankton. Meanwhile, warming resulted in a 3-fold increase in TP concentrations in the mesocosms with fish present. The results suggest that climate warming has the potential to boost eutrophication in shallow lakes via both top-down (loss of herbivores) and bottom-up (elevated nutrient) effects. However, in the mesocosms without fish, there was no decline in large Daphnia or in total zooplankton biomass, supporting the conclusion that fish predation is the major driver of low large Daphnia abundance in warm lakes. In the fishless mesocosms, phytoplankton biomass and nutrient levels were not affected by temperature. Our study suggests that removing fish to mitigate warming effects on eutrophication may be potentially beneficial in subtropical lakes, though the rapid recruitment of fish in such lakes may present a challenge to success in the long-term. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.watres.2018.07.055,shallow lake,China,31.4175,120.2203,Yes,No,2016-03-07,2016-07-03,,370,Outdoor,Not specified,3,eutrophic,,Yes,daily supply: 5 μg P L-1 d-1; 130 μg N L-1 d-1,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,Global temperatures have been rising for decades and are predicted to rise by an additional 3–5°C over the next century (IPCC 2014).,NA,Not provided,Not applicable,Yes,Not applicable,Not applicable,3,3,0,180,30,NP,NA,NA,ca 15,ca 27,,,Natural fluctuations due to air temperature changes,Fish ,3°C heated and unheated treatment are crossed with fish and no-fish treatments.,"Time-series development of chlorophyll a concentrations (a-b) and phytoplankton biomass.

Four of the seven experiments were carried out at different light levels (32-202 Wh m -2 at the start of the experiments) in the different experimental years. In one further experiment, the factors light and temperature were crossed, and in one experiment, the factors density of overwintering zooplankton and temperature were crossed. Overall, there was a slight temporal acceleration of the phytoplankton spring bloom, a decline of peak biomass and a decline of mean cell size with warming. The temperature influence on phytoplankton bloom timing, biomass and size structure was qualitatively highly robust across experiments. The dependence of timing, biomass, and size structure on initial conditions was tested by multiple regression analysis of the y-temperature regressions with the candidate independent variables initial light, initial phytoplankton biomass, initial microzooplankton biomass, and initial mesozooplankton (=copepod) biomass. The bloom timing predicted for mean temperatures (5. 28°C) depended on light. The peak biomass showed a strong positive dependence on light and a weaker negative dependence on initial copepod density. Mean phytoplankton cell size predicted for the mean temperature responded positively to light and negatively to copepod density. The anticipated mismatch between phytoplankton supply and food demand by newly hatched copepod nauplii occurred only under the combination of low light and warm temperatures. The analysis presented here confirms earlier conclusions about temperature responses that are based on subsets of our experimental series.

Four of the seven experiments were carried out at different light levels (32-202 Wh m -2 at the start of the experiments) in the different experimental years. In one further experiment, the factors light and temperature were crossed, and in one experiment, the factors density of overwintering zooplankton and temperature were crossed. Overall, there was a slight temporal acceleration of the phytoplankton spring bloom, a decline of peak biomass and a decline of mean cell size with warming. The temperature influence on phytoplankton bloom timing, biomass and size structure was qualitatively highly robust across experiments. The dependence of timing, biomass, and size structure on initial conditions was tested by multiple regression analysis of the y-temperature regressions with the candidate independent variables initial light, initial phytoplankton biomass, initial microzooplankton biomass, and initial mesozooplankton (=copepod) biomass. The bloom timing predicted for mean temperatures (5. 28°C) depended on light. The peak biomass showed a strong positive dependence on light and a weaker negative dependence on initial copepod density. Mean phytoplankton cell size predicted for the mean temperature responded positively to light and negatively to copepod density. The anticipated mismatch between phytoplankton supply and food demand by newly hatched copepod nauplii occurred only under the combination of low light and warm temperatures.

After the spring bloom, natural plankton were enclosed and treated in duplicates with inorganic nutrients elevated to pre-bloom conditions (N, P, Si; eutrophication), lowering of 0.4 pH units (acidification), and rising 3°C temperature (warming). All nutrient-amended treatments resulted in phytoplankton blooms dominated by chain-forming diatoms, and reached 13-16 mg chlorophyll (chl) a l-1. In the control mesocosms, chl a remained below 1 μg l-1. Acidification and warming had contrasting effects on the phenology and bloom-dynamics of autotrophic and heterotrophic microplankton. Bacillariophyceae, prymnesiophyceae, cryptophyta, and Protoperidinium spp. peaked earlier at higher temperature and lower pH. Chlorophyta showed lower peak abundances with acidification, but higher peak abundances with increased temperature. The peak magnitude of autotrophic dinophyceae and ciliates was, on the other hand, lowered with combined warming and acidification. Over time, the plankton communities shifted from autotrophic phytoplankton blooms to a more heterotrophic system in all mesocosms, especially in the control unaltered mesocosms. The development of mass balance and proportion of heterotrophic/autotrophic biomass predict a shift towards a more autotrophic community and less-efficient food web transfer when temperature, nutrients and acidification are combined in a future climate-change scenario. We suggest that this result may be related to a lower food quality for microzooplankton under acidification and warming scenarios and to an increase of catabolic processes compared to anabolic ones at higher temperatures. © 2014 Calbet et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0094388,"coastal (fjord, bay)",Norway,60.2689,5.2099,No,No,2011-06-10,2011-06-30,,2500,Outdoor,Not specified,2,NP,,No,NA,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,"They used modelled values from IPCC for the end of century, which predict a 3°C rise of temperature and a decrease of 0.4 pH units compared to the present levels [31].

Such changes may result in a reorganization of the plankton community structure, causing shifts in diversity and structure toward a community dominated by fewer species that are more adapted to endure warmer and irregular temperature conditions. We designed a long-term (8 months) mesocosm experiment to explore how ambient water temperature (C: control), induced increased temperature (T: +4 degrees C), and temperature fluctuations (F: +/- 4 degrees C relative to T) change phytoplankton phenology, taxonomical diversity, and community structure, and how such changes affected zooplankton abundance and composition. Synthesis. Our results show that T and F relative to C significantly decreased phytoplankton diversity. Moreover, there was a clear effect of the temperature treatments (T and F) on phytoplankton size structure that resulted in a significantly lower growth of large species (i.e., large Chlorophyta) compared to C. Decreased diversity and evenness in the T and F treatments pushed the community toward the dominance of only a few phytoplankton taxa (mainly Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta) that are better adapted to endure warmer and more irregular temperature conditions.

Concentrations of elements (Ba, Mn, S, Sr), nutrients (NH4 (+), PO4 (3-), Si), and greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) in the upper centimeter of the sediment were not affected by the hypolimnetic changes. Methane and carbon dioxide emission from the enclosures to the atmosphere were negligible. Bacterial and viral abundance in sediments were not affected by the treatment.

Here, we examined the phytoplankton community composition before, during, and after a simulated 1-month heat wave in a mesocosm facility in Silkeborg, Denmark. The experiment was conducted over three contrasting temperature scenarios (ambient (A0), Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A2 scenario (circa +3 degrees C, A2) and A2+ %50 (circa +4.5 degrees C, A2+)) crossed with two nutrient levels (low (LN) and high (HN)) with four replicates. The facility includes 24 mesocosms mimicking shallow lakes, which at the time of our experiment had run without interruption for 11 years. The 1-month heat wave effect was simulated by increasing the temperature by 5 degrees C (1 July to 1 August) in A2 and A2+, while A0 was not additionally heated. Throughout the study, HN treatments were mostly dominated by Cyanobacteria, whereas LN treatments were richer in genera and mostly dominated by Chlorophyta. Linear mixed model analyses revealed that high nutrient conditions were the most important structuring factor, which, regardless of temperature treatments and heat waves, increased total phytoplankton, Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, and Cyanobacteria biomasses and decreased genus richness and the grazing pressure of zooplankton. The effect of temperature was, however, modest. The effect of warming on the phytoplankton community was not significant before the heat wave, yet during the heat wave it became significant, especially in LN-A2+, and negative interaction effects between nutrient and A2+ warming were recorded. These warming effects continued after the heat wave, as also evidenced by Co-inertia analyses. In contrast to the prevailing theory stating that more diverse ecosystems would be more stable, HN were less affected by the heat wave disturbance, most likely because the dominant phytoplankton group cyanobacteria is adapted to high nutrient conditions and also benefits from increased temperature. We did not find any significant change in phytoplankton size diversity, but size evenness decreased in HN as a result of an increase in the smallest and largest size classes simultaneously. We conclude that the phytoplankton community was most strongly affected by the nutrient level, but less sensitive to changes in both temperature treatments and the heat wave simulation in these systems, which have been adapted for a long time to different temperatures. Moreover, the temperature and heat wave effects were observed mostly in LN systems, indicating that the sensitivity of phytoplankton community structure to high temperatures is dependent on nutrient availability.",10.3390/w12123394,shallow lake,Denmark,56.2333,9.5167,No,No,2014-06-16,2014-08-28,,2800,Outdoor,Not specified,Column only added afterwards,oligo-eutrophic,,Yes,Nutrients were added weekly to the high-nutrient treatment as Na2HPO4 and Ca(NO3)2 solutions (2.7 mg/m2 day-1 phosphorus and 27.1 mg/m2 day-1 nitrogen),Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,NP,1,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,5,5,5,11,31.5,19,20,10,"16, 19, 20.5","16, 19, 21.5",,,Temperature fluctuation based on natural deterministic and stochastic fluctuations,nutrients,"Nutrients (High, Low)","phytoplankton size, biovolume, biomass, grazing pressure, chlorophyll-a, macrophyte abundance, genus evenness, genus richness, resource-use efficiency, stability (resistance, resilience, recovery), phytoplankton size structure (size diversity, size evenness), biomass contributions of phytoplankton taxa",,,,

Extreme events, such as heat waves (HWs), are expected to become more frequent with global warming. To elucidate the effects of nutrients, warming, and HWs on zooplankton community structure, we conducted an experiment in 24 flow-through mesocosms (1.9 m in diameter, 1.0 m deep) imitating shallow lakes. The mesocosms have two nutrient levels (high (HN) and low (LN)) crossed with three temperature scenarios based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections of likely warming scenarios (unheated, A2, and A2 + 50%). The mesocosms had been running continuously with these treatments for 11 years prior to the HW simulation, which consisted of an additional 5 degrees C increase in temperature applied from 1 July to 1 August 2014. The results showed that nutrient effects on the zooplankton community composition and abundance were greater than temperature effects for the period before, during, and after the HW. Before the HW, taxon richness was higher, and functional group diversity and evenness were lower in HN than in LN. We also found a lower biomass of large Cladocera and a lower zooplankton: phytoplankton ratio, indicating higher fish predation in HN than in LN. Concerning the temperature treatment, we found some indication of higher fish predation with warming in LN, but no clear effects in HN. There was a positive nutrient and warming interaction for the biomass of total zooplankton, large and small Copepoda, and the zooplankton: phytoplankton ratio during the HW, which was attributed to recorded HW-induced fish kill. The pattern after the HW largely followed the HW response.

Some studies suggest a physical pathway of warming via stratification and nutrient flux, and others a biological effect on plankton metabolic rates; yet the relative strength and possible interaction of these mechanisms remains unknown. Here, we implement projections from a global circulation model in a mesocosm experiment to examine both mechanisms in a multi-trophic plankton community. Warming treatments had positive direct effects on phytoplankton biomass, but these were overcompensated by the negative effects of decreased nutrient flux. Zooplankton switched from phytoplankton to grazing on ciliates. These results contrast with previous experiments under nutrient-replete conditions, where warming indirectly reduced phytoplankton biomass via increased zooplankton grazing.

All mesocosms were exposed to a high nutrient loading rate (2.31 mmol N m(-3) d(-1):0.18 mmol P m(-1) d(-1):0.165 mmol Si m(-3) d(-1)). Three treatment mesocosms were maintained at a temperature elevated similar to 1 degrees C relative to the long-term (1977-1989) average, ambient temperature in the parent system, Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, and elevated similar to 3 degrees C from three control mesocosms. Warmer temperatures were hypothesized to result in lower phytoplankton biomass during the winter-spring bloom period as a result of increased grazing related to greater metabolic activity of both zooplankton and the benthos. Mean phytoplankton biomass and abundance were lower in the mesocosms with warmer temperatures. Well-developed phytoplankton blooms occurred in two of the: three cool systems. The presence of high numbers of filter-feeding mussels (Mytilus edulis) prevented a bloom from occurring in the third cool system. Unlike most benthic organisms, mussels continue to filter at high rates even at very low temperatures. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs), after adjusting for mussel biomass, revealed significant (P < 0.05) or near significant (P < 0.10) differences in phytoplankton (abundance and biomass), zooplankton abundance, and sedimentation rates between warm and cool treatments. Experimental and literature data were combined to develop carbon budgets for the six systems. Budgets for the warm systems indicated that carbon produced by phytoplankton was lost primarily by grazing of zooplankton, mussels, or both (29-55%) and to a lesser degree, by sedimentation (29-43%). In the cool systems without mussels, losses via sedimentation (73-82%) predominated. with an average ninefold increase in the amount of material supplied to the benthos relative to warm systems.",10.4319/lo.1999.44.2.0344,"coastal (fjord, bay)",USA,41.5830,-71.3667,No,No,1996-12-09,1997-02-03,,13000,Outdoor,No,3,eutrophic,Nutrient-rich,Yes,"Nitrogen (11.52 mmol m22 d21), phosphate (0.88 mmol m22 d21), and silicate (0.84 mmol m22 d21)",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,Not specified,Yes,No,NA,NA,Not provided,Not provided,Yes,Not applicable,Not applicable,-2; 1,"-2, 1",0,NP,NA,NP,NA,NA,5.9,"They had 2 treatments: 1°C warming, -2°C cooling and no control",,,Natural temperature fluctuations,NA,None,"Chl-a, phytoplankton abundance, zooplankton abundance, sedimentation rates, filtration rates of bivalves, ",,,"It is across two years, but December and February, so I put NOT multi-year.",

Rising temperature accelerated the onset of the phytoplankton bloom, while light intensity played only a minor role for the timing and bloom development. Maximum build-up of chlorophyll a and particulate organic carbon were similar to 20% lower at T + 6 compared with T + 0, probably caused by a combination of elevated heterotrophic processes and enhanced sedimentation during the bloom. The latter is supported by increased TEP concentrations at T + 6 (TEP/POC 0.18 mol C/mol C) compared with T + 0 (0.11 mol C/mol C) during bloom conditions, which may have promoted cell aggregation and sinking. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations increased more rapidly at elevated temperature. For a warmer future ocean, we can hence expect two counteracting mechanisms controlling organic matter flow during phytoplankton blooms: (1) enhanced processing of organic matter via the microbial loop resulting in a faster recycling and (2) depending on the dominating phytoplankton species, enhanced TEP formation resulting in increased particle aggregation and thus export of carbon and nutrients.",10.1093/plankt/fbu005,"coastal (fjord, bay)",Germany,54.8277,10.177558,No,No,2008-02-04,2008-03-19,,1400,Indoor,No,"6 (for the temperature), but they were again seperated into three light levels (so 2 replicates)",eutrophic,"Initial nutrient concentrations were 10 mmol L21 nitrate, 1.1 mmol L21 nitrite, 1.3 mmol L21 ammonium, 0.9 mmol L21 phosphate and 29.5 mmol L21 silicate",No,"To obtain a Redfield N/P ratio of 16 and to make the experiment

We measured responses of two species of larval amphibians, periphyton, and phytoplankton. Wood frog (Rana sylvatica) larvae developed quicker (odds ratio [OR] for 1°C increase = 0.903, 95% CI 0.892–0.912) and were more likely to metamorphose (OR 1.076, 95% CI 0.022–14.73) in warmer waters.

We aimed to determine how ARO and the frequency of its input can affect shallow lake ecosystems through direct and indirect effects on primary producers and primary consumers, and whether warming can mitigate or reinforce the impact of ARO. We performed a set of microcosm experiments simulating ARO using a cocktail of three organic pesticides (terbuthylazine, tebuconazole, pirimicarb), copper and nitrate. Two experiments were performed to determine the direct effect of ARO on primary producers (submerged macrophytes, periphyton and phytoplankton) and on the grazing snail Lymnaea stagnalis, respectively. Three different ARO concentrations added as single doses or as multiple pulses at two different temperatures (22°C and 26°C) were applied. In a third experiment, primary producers and consumers were exposed together to allow trophic interactions. When functional groups were exposed alone, ARO had a direct positive effect on phytoplankton and a strong negative effect on L. stagnalis. When exposed together, primary producer responses were contrasting, as the negative effect of ARO on grazers led to an indirect positive effect on periphyton. Periphyton in turn exerted a strong control on phytoplankton, leading to an indirect negative effect of ARO on phytoplankton. Macrophytes showed little response to the stressors. Multiple pulse exposure increased the effect of ARO on L. stagnalis and periphyton when compared with the same quantity of ARO added as a single dose. The increase in temperature had only limited effects. Our results highlight the importance of indirect effects of stressors, here mediated by grazers and periphyton, and the frequency of the ARO input in aquatic ecosystems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.watres.2020.116713,lake (not specified),NP,NP,NP,No,No,NP,NP,,8,No,No,5,NP,,Yes,It is a treatment and also the number of pulses is a treatment (see additional treatment column),Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,NA,NA,Not provided,Not provided,Not provided,Not applicable,Not applicable,2.3,2.3,NP,NP,21.4,NP,NA,NA,23.7,NA,,,None,Agricultural run-off ,"Agricultural run-off (Six different ARO treatments were used: a control with- out ARO; three treatments corresponding to the ARO at the low- est concentration (X), twice the lowest concentration (2X), and thrice the lowest concentration (3X) as a single addition at the beginning of the experiment; two treatments with two or three pulses of ARO at the lowest concentration (X) with four-day in- tervals between each addition (multiple pulse treatments XX and XXX, with the same final amount of ARO as in 2X and 3X, respec- tively.)","Number of pond snail eggs and juveniles, periphyton pigments, phytoplankton pigments, total planktonic biomass, periphytic algae biomass, biomass proportions of diatoms, green algae and cyanobacteria, total P concentration in periphyton biomass, macrophyte consumption, weight and size of pond snails, zebra mussel size, survival of zebra mussel and pond snail",,,"Only experiment 3 is considered here because it is the only one with a trophic interaction, sampling only at the end of the warming experiment (? but not sure)",

We manipulated three types of stressors acting in different time frames in an in situ experiment: ultraviolet radiation (UVR); phosphorus (P) concentration; temperature (T) in an oligotrophic Mediterranean high-mountain lake. The aim was to examine how the sensitivity of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton to UVR and their trophic relationship change under nutrient acclimation and abrupt temperature shifts. Phytoplankton and bacteria showed a common pattern of metabolic response to UVR × P addition interaction, with an increase in their production rates, although evidencing an inhibitory UVR effect on primary production (PP) but stimulatory on bacterial production (HBP). An abrupt T shift in plankton acclimated to UVR and P addition decreased the values of PP, evidencing an inhibitory UVR effect, whereas warming increased HBP and eliminated the UVR effect.

While warming is expected to have a pronounced effect on plankton communities, many components of the plankton seem fairly robust towards realistic end-of-century acidification conditions. However, interactions of the two stressors and the inclusion of further factors such as nutrient concentration and trophic interactions are expected to change this outcome. We investigated the effects of warming and high CO2 on a nutrient-deplete late summer plankton community from the Kiel Fjord, Baltic Sea, using a mesocosm setup crossing two temperatures with a gradient of CO2. Phytoplankton and microzooplankton (MZP) growth rates as well as biomass, taxonomic composition, and grazing rates of MZP were analysed. We observed effects of high CO2, warming, and their interactions on all measured parameters. The occurrence and direction of the effects were dependent on the phytoplankton or MZP community composition. In addition, the abundance of small-sized phytoplankton was identified as one of the most important factors in shaping the MZP community composition. Overall, our results indicate that an estuarine MZP community used to strong natural fluctuations in CO2 can still be affected by a moderate increase in CO2 if it occurs in combination with warming and during a nutrient-deplete post-bloom situation. This highlights the importance of including trophic interactions and seasonality aspects when assessing climate change effects on marine zooplankton communities. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s00227-020-03683-0,"coastal (fjord, bay)",Germany,54.8277,10.177558,No,No,2013-08-16,2013-09-13,,1400,Indoor,No,6,NP,,Not specified,-,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,NA,NA,Not provided,Not provided,Yes,Not applicable,Not applicable,3; -3,"3, -3",NP,NP,22.5,,NA,NA,19.5,NA,,,None,CO2 gradient,Gradient of CO2 values ranging from 500 to 3000 μatm.,"Flourescence, total alkalinity, DIC, nutrients, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, phytoplankton, carbonate system, microzooplankton biovolume and biomass, mesozooplankton biovolume and biomass",,,"The temperatures are a delta °C of 3°C above and below ambient of 19.5°C on the day of filling, but there is no ambient treatment.",

Here, we explore how the structure, function, and biodiversity of a planktonic metacommunity was altered after five years of experimental warming. Our outdoor mesocosm experiment was open to natural dispersal from the regional species pool, allowing us to explore the effects of experimental warming in the context of metacommunity dynamics. Warming of 4°C led to a 67% increase in the species richness of the phytoplankton, more evenly-distributed abundance, and higher rates of gross primary productivity. Warming elevated productivity indirectly, by increasing the biodiversity and biomass of the local phytoplankton communities. Warming also systematically shifted the taxonomic and functional trait composition of the phytoplankton, favoring large, colonial, inedible phytoplankton taxa, suggesting stronger top-down control, mediated by zooplankton grazing played an important role. Overall, our findings suggest that temperature can modulate species coexistence, and through such mechanisms, global warming could, in some cases, increase the species richness and productivity of phytoplankton communities. © 2015 Yvon-Durocher et al.",10.1371/journal.pbio.1002324,shallow lake,UK,50.2167,-2.1667,Yes,Yes,2006-09-01,2012-07-01,,1000,Outdoor,No,8,NP,,Not specified,-,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Not specified,Not specified,Yes,Yes,No,NA,NA,No,No,Yes,Not applicable,Not applicable,4.3,4.3,NP,NP,17.7,5 years,NA,NA,13.4,NA,,,NP,NA,-,"Plankton abundance, zooplankton abundance, zooplankton biomass, organism size, biovolumes, planktonic and benthic metabolism, ",,,"Study period is only July 2011 until July 2012, but warming was since much earlier",

Climate change may impact most strongly on temperate lake plankton communities in spring, when light availability and water temperature change rapidly due to thermal stratification. Effects of changing light and temperature on one food-web component transfer to other components, producing a complex interplay between physical drivers and biotic feedbacks. Understanding this interplay is important, because altered climate regimes could result in phenological mismatch between the phytoplankton spring bloom and the timing of maximum food requirements of grazers. 2. To separate direct effects of light and temperature on spring plankton dynamics from effects mediated through micro-and mesograzer feedbacks, we manipulated water temperature, stratification depth and presence/absence of the mesograzer Daphnia in lake mesocosms. 3. In early spring, stratification depth and water temperature directly influenced the light supply to phytoplankton and the growth rates of all plankton groups. Subsequently, indirect effects, including light-dependent food supply to grazers and temperature-dependent grazing pressure, became increasingly important. Phytoplankton and Daphnia peaked earlier in warmer treatments and reached higher peaks when stratification depth was shallower. Ciliates responded positively to increased food density and higher temperature and subsequently affected the taxonomic composition, but not the total biomass, of phytoplankton. 4. In the absence of Daphnia, phytoplankton did not enter a distinct clear water phase. When present, Daphnia caused an extended clear water phase, maintaining phytoplankton and ciliates at low levels throughout early summer and suppressing all direct effects of physical drivers on these plankton groups. 5. Our Daphnia treatments mimicked the high and low fish predation settings of the largely descriptive, recently revised Plankton Ecology Group (PEG) model of seasonal plankton succession and explored their responses to climate change scenarios. The results largely support the PEG model, but attribute greater importance to early season temperature effects and later season grazing effects of Daphnia. 6. In warmer treatments, the timing of phytoplankton and zooplankton peaks tended to be more closely coupled, and temperature did not affect the height of zooplankton peaks. In line with other experiments, these results do not support the widely held concern that warming may create a trophic mismatch between phytoplankton and zooplankton and reduce spring zooplankton production. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",10.1111/fwb.12424,lake (not specified),Germany,47.9333,12.4333,Yes,No,2007-03-20,2007-06-05,,3540,In-Situ,Yes,2,oligo-eutrophic,all mesocosms were fertilised once at the beginning of the experiment with KH2PO4 from an ambient level of 8 lg L1 total phosphorus (TP) to an initial concentration of 24.5 lg TP L1 to simulate the nutrient pulse associated with spring overturn.,No,-,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,Not specified,Yes,No,NA,NA,Yes,Yes,Yes,Not applicable,Not applicable,NE,NE,NE,NE,NE,NE,NA,NA,NE (~6),NE,,,Natural temperature fluctuations,zooplankton community; stratification,"we cross-classified two types of zooplankton communities (the ambient microzooplankton community of the lake in presence versus absence of stocked Daphnia hyalina) with three stratification depths (1.5, 3.5 and 6.5 m)","Phytoplankton biomass, ciliate biomass, phytoplankton size classes, Daphnia individuals",,,,

Evidence is accumulating that increasing temperature is also linked to reduced body size of ectotherms. While temperature can act directly on body size, it may also act indirectly by affecting the timing of life-cycle events and the resulting population age and size structure, especially in seasonal environments. Population structure may, in turn, be influenced by temperature-driven changes in resource availability. In a field mesocosm experiment, we investigated how water temperature and mixed surface layer depth (a temperature-dependent determinant of light availability to phytoplankton) affected population dynamics, population age and size structure, and individual size at stage (size at first reproduction) of Daphnia hyalina during and after a phytoplankton spring bloom. Mixed layer depth was inversely related to the magnitudes of the phytoplankton spring bloom and the subsequent Daphnia peak, but had no effect on the body size of Daphnia. Conversely, temperature had no effects on abundance peaks but strongly affected the timing of these events. This resulted in at times positive, at other times negative, transient effects of temperature on mean body size, caused by asynchronous changes in population size structure in cold versus warm treatments. In contrast to mean body size, individual size at stage consistently decreased with increasing temperature. We suggest that size at stage could be used as an unbiased response parameter to temperature that is unaffected by transient, demographically driven changes in population size structure. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/s00227-012-1931-8,,,,,,,NA,NA,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NA,,"Chlorophyll-a, Daphnia abundance, egg-bearing female Daphnia, Daphnia mean size, size at first reproduction of Daohnia",,,It is the same experiment as in line 53 (Berger et al. 2014),

Most importantly, interactions among ecological stressors generate nonadditive effects that cannot be easily predicted based on single-stressor studies. Here, we corroborate findings from an in situ mesocosm experiment with evidence from a whole-ecosystem manipulation to demonstrate for the first time that interactions between climate and acidification determine their cumulative impact on the food-web structure of coldwater lakes. Interactions among warming, drought, and acidification, rather than the sum of their individual effects, best explained significant changes in planktonic consumer and producer biomass over a 23-year period. Further, these stressors interactively exerted significant synergistic and antagonistic effects on consumers and producers, respectively.

This will increase the importance of the heterotrophic microbial food web in areas like the northern Baltic Sea. Such a structural change in the pelagic food web would hamper benthic productivity, since microheterotrophs have lower settling rates than phytoplankton. We tested how variation in temperature and alteration of the pelagic food web structure affected the productivity of a key benthic species, the amphipod Monoporeia affinis, and the pelagic-benthic food web efficiency (FWE). Using water from the northern Baltic Sea, a mesocosm experiment was performed in which the temperature was altered by 5°C. The structure of the pelagic food web changed from one based on algae to one based on bacteria. Amphipod productivity was 3 times higher and FWE was 25 times higher in the algae than in the bacteria-based food web, showing that an altered pelagic food web will have severe effects on benthic productivity. Temperature variation, on the other hand, did not cause any changes in either growth of M. affinis or FWE. Our data indicate that indirect effects of climate change, leading to structural changes in the pelagic food web, will have much more severe effects on benthic productivity than the direct effect of increased temperature. © inter-research 2009.",10.3354/meps08290,"coastal (fjord, bay)",Sweden,NP,NP,No,No,NP,NP,,NP,,No,4,eutrophic,Manipulated during experiment,Yes,"A phytoplankton-based pelagic food web was created by the addition of N and P twice a week, in the forms of ammonium 0.53 μmol l–1 d–1, nitrate 3.15 μmol l–1 d–1 and phosphate 0.23 μmol l–1 d–1.

Treatments were partitioned in duplicate and results were tested at the 95% confidence level with a randomized-block analysis of variance. The studies were made between 9 February and 18 April 1970 in four 14-m3 plastic pools located adjacent to the Pamlico River estuary, North Carolina, U.S.A. Temperatures in the two control pools ranged from 5 to 19 °C and in heated pools from 10 to 27 °C during the study. Heated pools averaged 5·5 °C warmer than unheated. The only statistically significant effect noted on phytoplankton class composition was an increase in the dinoflagellate cell concentrations in the heated pools. Phytoplankton populations in the heated pools were more diverse and were composed of larger cells (cells averaged 5·2 times larger in volume) than in controls. It appeared that the warming tended to accelerate the succession of the late winter-early spring population and produced a more mature successional stage. Thus the warming of brackish water, possibly by heated effluents from electric generating plants, can alter the composition of phytoplankton populations. © 1973.",10.1016/0302-3524(73)90055-8,brackish,USA,35.3071,-76.7915,No,No,1970-02-09,1970-04-18,,14000,Outdoor,Not specified,2,NP,,Not specified,-,Yes,Not specified,No,Not specified,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,NA,NA,Not provided,Not provided,Yes,Not applicable,Not applicable,5,5,0,NE,NE,NE,NA,NA,NE,NE,,,Natural fluctuations?,NA,No,"Phytoplankton counts,  phytoplankton cell volume, Shannon diversity",,,,

The mesocosms were filled with winter water from the Kiel Fjord, Baltic Sea. Two of them were started at ∼2°C and the temperature was subsequently increased according to the decadal temperature profile of the fjord (ΔT 0°C, baseline treatment). The other mesocosms were run at 3 elevated temperatures with differences of ΔT+2, +4 and +6°C. All mesocosms were exposed to the same light conditions. Timing of peak phytoplankton primary production (PP) during the experimental spring bloom was not significantly influenced by increasing temperatures, whereas the peak of bacterial secondary production (BSP) was accelerated by about 2 d per °C. This suggests that, in case of warming, the spring peak of bacterial degradation of organic matter (in terms of BSP) would occur earlier in the year. Furthermore, the lag time between the peaks of PP and BSP (about 16 d for ΔT 0°C) would diminish progressively at elevated temperatures. The average ratio between BSP and PP increased significantly from 0.37 in the coldest mesocosms to 0.63 in the warmest ones. Community respiration and the contribution of picoplankton (<3 μm fraction) to this also increased at elevated temperatures. Our results lead to the prediction that climate warming during the winter/early spring in temperate climate zones will favor bacterial degradation of organic matter by tightening the coupling between phytoplankton and bacteria. However, if PP is reduced by warming, as in our experiments, this will not necessarily lead to increased recycling of organic matter (and CO2). © Inter-Research 2008.",10.3354/ame01198,"coastal (fjord, bay)",Germany,54.8277,10.177558,No,No,2005-02-07,2005-04-25,,1400,Indoor,No,2,eutrophic,"The initial concentrations of nutrients in the mesocosms were representative of those in the fjord during winter: nitrate 21.49 μmol l–1, ammonia 2.2 μmol l–1, phosphate 0.78 μmol l–1, silicate 24.70 μmol l–1.",Not specified,-,Yes,Yes,No,Not specified,No,No,Not specified,Yes,No,NA,NA,Not provided,Not provided,Yes,Not applicable,Not applicable,2;4;6,"2,4,6",0,NE,NE,NE,NA,NA,2,NE,,,Increase according to decadal mean temperature over the course of the experiment,NA,-,"Chlorophyll-a, primary production, counts of bacteria and nanoflagellates, bacterial growth, respiration of the community",,,,

Phytoplankton biomass during the experimental period decreased with warming and with higher densities of overwintering zooplankton. Similarly, average cell size and average effective particle size (here: colony size) decreased both with zooplankton density and warming.

Dinitrogen (N2) fixation is a major component of nitrogen cycling in freshwater systems, yet little is known with respect to how diazotrophic (N2 fixing) cyanobacteria respond to heat waves. Here, we quantified the effects of elevated temperature and fixed N enrichment on the growth and N2 fixation rates of Dolichospermum isolates from differing latitudes and cyanobacterial communities in four lakes across New York state, USA, during the summer and early fall. In culture experiments, temperatures >= 26 degrees C significantly reduced maximum growth rates of the sub-polar Dolichospermum strains from Finland relative to those grown at 20-25 degrees C, while a strain of Dolichospermum isolated from subtropical Australia grew significantly faster at 20- 30 degrees C compared to cooler temperatures. All strains, however, exhibited significantly lower N2 fixation rates at higher temperatures (29 - 30 degrees C) relative to lower temperatures (13-26 degrees C). During ecosystem-based experiments with cyanobacterial communities comprised of Nostocales and other diazotrophic cyanobacteria, short-term (3-4 day) exposures to elevated temperatures mimicking heat waves (+3-6 degrees C; 27-31 degrees C) and/or N (NH4+) enrichment caused a significant increase in cyanobacterial net growth rates but also caused a significant decline in N-2 fixation rates. Collectively, results indicate that while heat waves and fixed N loading can promote cyanobacterial communities, they also suppress diazotrophy, which is generally regarded as a significant component of nitrogen cycling in eutrophic freshwater systems.

We used a controlled indoor-mesocosm set-up to test the effect of a temperature fluctuation frequency gradient on a natural phytoplankton community. Within a frequency gradient, we allowed the temperature to fluctuate from 18 +/- 3 degrees C at different rates (6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h). The temperature fluctuation frequency gradient was contrasted to a constant temperature treatment with the same mean temperature (18 degrees C). Phytoplankton biomass tended to increase with faster fluctuations but was lowest in the diurnal frequency treatment (24 h). In comparison with constant conditions, diurnal or slower fluctuation frequencies showed lower or comparable performance, whereas faster fluctuations showed higher performance. In addition, minor differences in community structure were observed, but species diversity remained comparable over time. Similarly, resource use efficiency and stoichiometry did not change according to fluctuation frequency treatments. We conclude that the effect of temperature fluctuations on phytoplankton biomass depends on the fluctuation frequency; this suggests that the fluctuation frequency determines how organisms average their environments. However, this trend is not driven by species identity but physiological responses.

The biomass and composition of periphyton were not significantly affected by increased temperature, while the biomass of phytoplankton increased with a shift in phytoplankton composition towards higher dominance of chlorophytes and cyanobacteria.

At both ambient and heated temperatures, a shift occurred at the end of the experiment from a clear-state dominated by P. crispus to a clear-state dominated by filamentous algae and warming facilitated this shift.

Thus, the latter groups dominated at increased light levels. Warming increased mesozooplankton grazing on medium-sized algae, reducing their biomass. The biomass of small-sized algae was not affected by temperature, probably due to an interplay between indirect effects spreading through the food web.

Periphyton growth (measured as chlorophyll a) was investigated four times in situ using nutrient-diffusing substrata. The effect of grazing was also manipulated using exclusion cages. We found that periphyton responded differently to nutrient addition bioassays (N and P) depending on the background nutrient concentration and warming scenario. Our results indicate that single-nutrient limitation prevailed for periphyton in our experimental temperate shallow lakes. The responses were season sensitive. Periphyton in the unenriched mesocosms were P-limited in early summer in the ambient and A2 scenarios, N-limited in late summer in these two climate scenarios, not nutrient-limited in autumn and P-limited in spring in all climate scenarios.

In contrast, periphyton in the enriched mesocosms showed no clear nutrient limitation, except for short-term periods of P limitation in the warmer systems. Grazers did not affect the quantitative response of periphyton to nutrient addition, and the concentrations of P and N as well as mean monthly temperature were the main environmental factors driving P or N limitation.

A potentially equally pervasive, but less acknowledged threat to the temporal coherence of consumer-resource interactions is mismatch in food quality. Many plant and algal communities respond to warming with shifts toward more carbon-rich species and growth forms, thereby diluting essential elements in their biomass and intensifying the stoichiometric mismatch with herbivore nutrient requirements. Here we report on a mesocosm experiment on the spring succession of an assembled plankton community in which we manipulated temperature (ambient vs. +3.6°C) and presence versus absence of two types of grazers (ciliates and Daphnia), and where warming caused a dramatic regime shift that coincided with extreme stoichiometric mismatch. At ambient temperatures, a typical spring succession developed, where a moderate bloom of nutritionally adequate phytoplankton was grazed down to a clear-water phase by a developing Daphnia population. While warming accelerated initial Daphnia population growth, it speeded up algal growth rates even more, triggering a massive phytoplankton bloom of poor food quality. Consistent with the predictions of a stoichiometric producer–grazer model, accelerated phytoplankton growth promoted the emergence of an alternative system attractor, where the extremely low phosphorus content of the abundant algal food eventually drove Daphnia to extinction. Where present, ciliates slowed down the phytoplankton bloom and the deterioration of its nutritional value, but this only delayed the regime shift. Eventually, phytoplankton also grew out of grazer control in the presence of ciliates, and the Daphnia population crashed. To our knowledge, the experiment is the first empirical demonstration of the “paradox of energy enrichment” (grazer starvation in an abundance of energy-rich but nutritionally imbalanced food) in a multispecies phytoplankton community. More generally, our results support the notion that warming can exacerbate the stoichiometric mismatch at the plant–herbivore interface and limit energy transfer to higher trophic levels. © 2022 The Authors.

The separate influences of temperature and resource-dependency on phytoplankton growth, community, and ecosystem metabolism are relatively well understood. However, winners and losers in the ocean are determined based on the interplay among often rapidly changing biological, chemical and physical drivers. The direct, indirect, and interactive effects of these conditions on planktonic food web structure and function are poorly constrained. Here, we investigated how simultaneous manipulation of temperature and nutrient availability affects trophic transfer from phytoplankton to herbivorous protists, and their resulting implications at the ecosystem level. Temperature directly affected herbivorous protist composition; ciliates dominated (66%) in colder treatment and dinoflagellates (60%) at warmer temperatures. Throughout the experiments, grazing rates were < 0.1 d−1, with higher rates at subzero temperatures. Overall, the nutrient–temperature interplay affected trophic transfer rates antagonistically when nutrients were amended, and synergistically, when nutrients were not added. This interaction resulted in higher percentages of primary production consumed under nutrient unamended compared to nutrient amended conditions. At the ecosystem level, these changes may determine the fate of primary production, with most of the production likely exported out of the pelagic zone in high-temperature and nutrient conditions, while high-temperature and low-nutrient availability strengthened food web coupling and enhanced trophic transfer. These results imply that in warming oceans, management of coastal nutrient loading will be a critical determinant of the degree of primary production removal by microzooplankton and dependent ecosystem production. © 2022 The Authors.

However, knowledge of how temperature and light synergistically impact phytoplankton community shifts and cyanobacterial dominance is limited. In this study, we performed a long-term data analysis and an outdoor mesocosm experiment to detect the synergistic effect of temperature and light on shift of phytoplankton community and dominance of bloom-forming cyanobacteria in Lake Taihu, China. The results showed that cyanobacterial biomass was boosted alone and jointly by increased temperature and decreased light levels (sunshine hours and light intensity), and the interaction might be more important than temperature or light levels independently. Chlorophyta biomass was driven by the joint effect of temperature and light levels. Bacillariophyta biomass was mainly affected by light levels, and decreased with declining light levels. Our results emphasize that the interactions of temperature and light have an important impact on the shift of the phytoplankton community in spring. Increasing temperature and declining underwater light boosted the flourishing of cyanobacteria, especially Microcystis, and were adverse to the development of diatoms in spring. Our findings contribute to an increased understanding of the effects of temperature and light on phytoplankton composition shifts and the development of cyanobacterial dominance in spring. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.hal.2022.102252,lake (not specified),China,31.41750,120.22028,No,No,2015-03-26,2015-05-10,,200,Outdoor,Not specified,3,NP,,Yes,every 5d to Lake Taihu levels,Yes,Yes,No,Not specified,Not specified,Not specified,Not specified,Yes,No,NA,NA,Not applicable,Not applicable,Not applicable,Not applicable,Not applicable,3,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NE,NE,,,diurnal,light levels,light levels,"chla, biomass, community composition",,,,

During this experiment, a phytoplankton bloom occurred and the abundances of several cytometric groups of phytoplankton (cyanobacteria, picophytoplankton and nanophytoplankton) and bacteria (low- and high-nucleic acid bacteria), as well as their growth and grazing mortality rates and their carbon biomass, were studied over the course of the experiment. Experimental warming led to a significant reduction of 47% of the phytoplankton biomass in average, based on Chl-a concentrations. This reduction was also observed for nanophytoplankton abundances during the whole experiment and for eukaryotic picophytoplankton only during the bloom period. This result coincided with a significant decrease in orthophosphate concentrations under warming during the prebloom and bloom periods simultaneous to an increase in bacterial abundances. At the same time, the higher growth rates of bacteria and the lower ones of phytoplankton observed at the beginning of the bloom could suggest that competition between phytoplankton and bacteria for orthophosphate might have contributed to the phytoplankton biomass decrease under warming. In addition, higher grazing mortality rates of phytoplankton groups under warming, notably nanophytoplankton at the end of the bloom and in postbloom (by 59 to 626%), as well as eukaryotic picophytoplankton over the course of the experiment (by 58 to 255%) could also have contributed to the lower phytoplankton biomass under warming. Based on these results, estimations of average phytoplankton carbon biomass production and transfer showed reductions of 42 and 45%, respectively, under warming, whereas those of bacteria were enhanced by 13 and 8%, respectively. These results indicated that warming induced a shift at the base of the microbial food web, going toward a more bacteria-based system. This suggested that under future warming scenarios, the microbial food web could become less productive and could negatively affect the functioning of the whole food web in coastal waters.

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is associated with harmful disinfection byproducts and reduced aesthetic quality, and its removal is the major treatment cost. Littoral zones are known to be disproportionately important for DOC production through macrophyte inputs, and such communities are predicted to expand with warming in northern regions. However, little is known about autochthonous DOC contributions and their response to climatic change. Here we exposed mesocosms to elevated CO2 (eCO2), warming and a combined treatment across a trophic gradient. Regression analysis indicated that while sediments, macrophytes, and phytoplankton are important DOC sources (P < 0.05), benthic algal biomass showed the strongest relationship with DOC (P < 0.05), suggesting it is an underestimated source. DOC removal indicators, namely phenol oxidase (depolymerization) and respiration (mineralization) were inversely related to DOC concentration in oligohumic (P < 0.05) and oligotrophic (P < 0.1) systems, suggesting heterotrophic processes are important in DOC removal. DOC concentrations increased across all systems (P < 0.05), irrespective of trophic status, due to increased photoautotrophic inputs (macrophyte, pelagic, and benthic algae) under eCO2, warming, and combined scenarios, with inhibited depolymerization and mineralization under eCO2, even when combined with warming (P < 0.05 and P < 0.05 excepting the oligo-mesotrophic reservoir P < 0.1 respectively). Increased DOC loads of all fractions, regardless of provenance, are predicted in a future climate and, thus, investment in techniques to remove a greater range of DOC fractions is proposed to help “future proof” drinking water supplies. © 2021.

A heatwave was simulated by elevating the water temperature of three mesocosms to +3°C while three control mesocosms had natural lagoon water temperature, for 10 days. Further, the heating procedure was halted for 10 days to study the resilience and recovery of the system. Automated high frequency monitoring of dissolved oxygen concentration and saturation, chlorophyll-a fluorescence, photosynthetic active radiation, salinity, and water temperature was completed with manual sampling for nutrient and phytoplankton pigment analyses. High-frequency data were used to estimate different functional processes: gross primary production (GPP), community respiration (R), and phytoplankton growth (μ), and loss (l) rates. Ecosystem stability was assessed by calculating resistance, resilience, recovery, and temporal stability in terms of the key functions (GPP, R, μ, and l). Meanwhile, the composition of phytoplankton functional types (PFT) was assessed through chemotaxonomic pigment composition. During the heatwave, GPP, R, μ, and l increased by 31, 49, 16, and 21%, respectively, compared to the control treatment. These positive effects persisted several days after the offset of the heatwave, resulting in low resilience in these key functions. However, GPP and R recovered almost completely at the end of the experiment, suggesting that the effect of the heatwave on these two rates was reversible. The heatwave also affected the PFT composition, as diatoms, prymnesiophytes, and cyanobacteria were favored, whereas dinoflagellates were negatively affected. By highlighting important effects of a simulated marine heatwave on the metabolism and functioning of a coastal Mediterranean plankton community, this study points out the importance to extend this type of experiments to different sites and conditions to improve our understanding of the impacts of this climate-change related stressor that will grow in frequency and intensity in the future.

While the edible phytoplankton responded predominantly negative to warming and the inedible group stayed unaffected or increased, independent from edibility most phytoplankton groups gained from CO2. Because the ratio between edible and inedible taxa changes profoundly over seasons, we investigated if community responses can be predicted according to the prevailing composition of edible and inedible groups. We experimentally explored the combined effects of elevated temperatures and CO2 concentrations on a late‐summer Baltic Sea community. Total phytoplankton significantly increased in response to elevated CO2 in particular in combination with temperature, driven by a significant gain of the inedible <5 μm fraction and large filamentous cyanobacteria. Large flagellates disappeared. The edible group was low as usual in summer and decreased with both factors due to enhanced copepod grazing and overall decline of small flagellates. Our results emphasize that the responses of summer communities are complex, but can be predicted by the composition and dominance of size classes and groups. © 2021 by the authors.

The effects of these changes on different component of the ecosystem were assessed in an experiment using twenty-four large (3000L)outdoor mesocosms simulating shallow lakes. Two different temperature regimes (ambient and ambient +4 °C)combined with three levels of organic matter (OM, added as filtered peaty water), simulating the DOC increase that is predicted to take place over the next 4 to 21 years were used. Neither temperature nor OM had significant effects on net ecosystem production, respiration or gross primary production. Phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentration was not significantly affected by warming, however in summer, autumn and winter it was significantly higher in mesocosms receiving intermediate OM levels (July–Feb DOC concentrations 2–6 mg L  −1  ). Summer cyanobacterial blooms were highest in intermediate, and lowest in the highest OM treatments. OM concentration also influenced total macroinvertebrate abundance which was greater in spring and summer in mesocosms with intermediate and high OM. Fish abundance was not significantly affected by OM concentration, but abundance was greater in ambient (55 fish subsample  −1  )compared to heated mesocosms (17 fish subsample  −1  )and maximum abundance occurred two weeks later compared to heated mesocosms. The results suggest that changes in OM may have a greater effect on shallow lakes than temperature and that phytoplankton, especially cyanobacteria, benefit from intermediate OM concentrations, therefore, nuisance algal blooms might increase in relatively clear shallow eutrophic lakes where DOC concentrations increase. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.105,lake (not specified),UK,54.23333,-14.95000,Yes,No,2013-02-01,2012-02-01,,3000,Outdoor,No,4,eutrophic,,Yes,biweekly; 300 μg N L−1 and 42 μg P L−1,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Not specified,Yes,No,NA,NA,Not applicable,Not applicable,Not applicable,Not applicable,Not applicable,4,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NE,NE,,,"diurnal, seasonal",organic matter,organic matter,"macroinvertebrates; phytoplankton chla, fish",,,,

Many of these evolutionarily diverse microalgae are also capable of feeding on other microbes, and hence simultaneously act both as primary producers and consumers. The net ecosystem impact of such mixotrophs depends on their nutritional strategy which is likely to alter with environmental change. Many temperate lakes are currently warming at unprecedented rates and are simultaneously increasing in water color (browning) due to increased run-off of humic substances. We hypothesized that the resulting reduction in light intensity and increased bacterial abundances would favor mixotrophic phytoplankton over obligate autotrophs, while higher temperatures might boost their rates of bacterivory. We tested these hypotheses in a mesocosm experiment simulating a gradient of increasing temperature and water color in temperate shallow lakes as expected to occur over the coming century. Mixotrophs showed a faster increase in abundance under the climate change scenario during spring, when they dominated the phytoplankton community. Furthermore, both bacterial abundances and rates of phytoplankton bacterivory increased under future climate conditions. Bacterivory contributed significantly to phytoplankton resource acquisition under future climate conditions, while remaining negligible throughout most of the season in treatments resembling today's conditions. Hence, to our knowledge, we here provide the first evidence for an increasing importance of bacterivory by phytoplankton in future temperate shallow lakes.

We focused on quantifying effects on timing and magnitude of plankton spring phenological events and identifying possible mismatches between resources (phytoplankton) and consumers (zooplankton). We found that the increases in TB had important effects on timing and abundance of different plankton groups. While increased temperature led to an earlier peak in phytoplankton and zooplankton and a change in the relative timing of different zooplankton groups, increased water colour reduced chlorophyll-a concentrations. Increased TB together benefitted cladocerans and calanoid copepods and led to stronger top-down control of algae by zooplankton.

We studied individual and combined effects of increased temperature and UVBR on the plankton community of the Beagle Channel, southern Patagonia, Argentina. Eight 2 m3 mesocosms were exposed to 4 treatments (with 2 replicates) during 10 d: (1) control (natural temperature and UVBR), (2) increased UVBR (simulating a 60% decrease in stratospheric ozone layer thickness), (3) increased temperature (+ 3 °C), and (4) simultaneous increased temperature and UVBR (60% decrease in stratospheric ozone; + 3 °C). Two distinct situations were observed with regard to phytoplankton biomass: bloom (Days 1-4) and postbloom (Days 5-9). Significant decreases in micro-sized diatoms (>20 μm), bacteria, chlorophyll a, and particulate organic carbon concentrations were observed during the post-bloom in the enhanced temperature treatments relative to natural temperature, accompanied by significant increases in nanophytoplankton (10-20 μm, mainly prymnesiophytes). The decrease in microsized diatoms in the high temperature treatment may have been caused by a physiological effect of warming, although we do not have activity measurements to support this hypothesis. Prymnesiophytes benefited from micro-sized diatom reduction in their competition for resources. The bacterial decrease under warming may have been due to a change in the dissolved organic matter release caused by the observed change in phytoplankton composition.

With temperatures and nutrient runoff predicted to increase within the next decades, climate change poses a threat to lake communities. However, current predictions on the effect of these environmental factors on the abundance and timing of peak zooplankton numbers are based on correlations rather than on experimental isolation of thermal from other confounding effects. We present results of warming (4°C above ambient) and increased nutrient loading on plankton communities in 48 outdoor mesocosms, simulating fishless and hypertrophic ponds. The timing of the chlorophyll a peak and crustacean zooplankton peak abundance, dominated by Daphnia pulex, responded strongly to temperature and nutrient addition. Daphnia numbers reached peaks 22-24 days earlier in heated than in unheated mesocosms. The chlorophyll a peak abundance advanced by 15-19 days with heating. Phytoplankton, total zooplankton and D. pulex reached peak abundance 12-19 days later when doses of nitrogen and phosphorus were added; this finding contradicts predicted earlier phytoplankton and zooplankton spring peak abundances with nutrient enrichment. Peak zooplankton and D. pulex abundances did not differ with temperature treatment, contrary to our expectations, but peak abundances occurred at similar actual temperatures. Nutrient additions had no effect on the peak zooplankton and D. pulex abundances in our mesocosms. Overall, climate warming is likely to advance plankton phenology in fishless ponds; however, this advance could be dampened in systems with high nutrient concentration. We found very high zooplankton abundances with warming and high nutrient loadings inducing a clear water state in all our tanks owing to heavy zooplankton grazing despite high nutrient concentrations. © The Author 2010.

Therefore, we performed phytoplankton experiments with a factorial combination of warming and consumer type (protist feeding mainly on small algae vs. copepods mainly feeding on large algae). Natural phytoplankton was exposed to 3 (1st experiment) or 4 (2nd experiment) temperature levels and 3 (1st experiment: nano-, microzooplankton, copepods) or 2 (2nd experiment: microzooplankton, copepods) types of consumers. Size shifts of individual phytoplankton species and community mean size were analyzed. Both, mean cell size of most of the individual species and mean community cell size decreased with temperature under all grazing regimes. Grazing by copepods caused an additional reduction in cell size. Our results reject the hypothesis, that intensified size selective consumption at higher temperature would be the dominant explanation of decreasing body size. In this case, the size reduction would have taken place only in the copepod treatments but not in the treatments with protist grazing (nano- and microzooplankton). © 2012 Peter and Sommer.",10.1371/journal.pone.0049632,"coastal (fjord, bay)",Germany,54.32811,10.17936,No,No,2012-07-05,2012-07-28,,300,Indoor,Not specified,3,NP,,Yes,"once at the beggining; addition concentrations NP, giving starting conc",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,Not specified,Yes,No,NA,NA,Not applicable,Not applicable,Not applicable,Not applicable,Not applicable,4.5; 3; 2.5,"4,5; 3; 2,5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,grazing,grazing,"phyto abundance, community comp, biomass, cell size",,,,

Therefore, we hypothesized that warming of fishless alpine ponds would suppress large-bodied consumers (e.g., cladocerans, copepods) and stimulate fast-growing microorganisms (e.g., phytoflagellates, rotifers), thereby altering the community composition and total abundance of zooplankton and phytoplankton. This hypothesis was tested using three blocks of four experimental mesocosms (1000-liter capacity) that were located next to alpine ponds in Banff National Park, Canada. Each block received unfiltered pond water and sediment from a pond following ice out in June 2000. A warming treatment (control vs. 3.6°C warmed) was achieved by controlling the ventilation of greenhouse canopies that were suspended over each of the mesocosms. By the end of our 50-d experiment, warming significantly suppressed total zooplankton biomass because large cladocerans (Daphnia pulex) declined while rotifer (Keratella cochlearis, Conochilus unicornis) abundance increased during the second half of the experiment. In contrast, warming did not affect total phytoplankton biomass but significantly altered community composition by favoring phytoflagellates (Mallomonas, Synura, Trachelomonas) over larger filamentous green algae (Mougeotia, Phymatodocis). Warming did not significantly increase dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Therefore, warmer growing conditions and reduced grazer biomass best explained the increased abundance of more edible, fast-growing phytoflagellates in the warmed mesocosms. Our findings support the hypothesis that moderate warming can destabilize plankton dynamics, thereby potentially reducing the reliability of water quality and food resources for higher trophic levels (e.g., planktivorous fish) in shallow cold-water ecosystems.",10.4319/lo.2004.49.4.1182,pond,Canada,51.58333,115.81667,No,No,2000-07-01,2000-08-19,,900,In-Situ,Not specified,2,NP,,Not specified,,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,Not specified,Not specified,Yes,No,NA,NA,No,Not applicable,Not applicable,Not applicable,Not applicable,3.6,"3,6",NP,NA,"30,1",NA,NA,NA,NE,NE,,,diurnal,NA,,phytoplankon biomass; zooplankton biomass,,"CCA of phyto community composition; rotifres, copepods and clasdocerans for zooplankton",,

It is, therefore, important to know how shallow lake ecosystems will respond to the current climate change. Global warming affects not only average temperatures, but also the frequency of heat waves (HW). The impact of extreme events on ecosystems processes, particularly greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, is uncertain. Using the world's longest-running shallow lake experiment, we studied the effects of a simulated summer HW on the fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The experimental mesocosms had been exposed to different temperature treatments and nutrient loading for 11years prior to the artificial HW. In general, there was an increase in total GHG emissions during the 1-month artificial HW, with a significant increase in CO2, CH4 and N2O being observed in the shallow lake mesocosms. No significant effect of the HW on CO2 emissions could be traced, though, in the mesocosms with high nutrient levels. Furthermore, the data suggested that in addition to the direct effect of increased temperature on metabolic processes during the HW, biotic interactions exerted a significant control of GHG emissions. For example, at low nutrient levels, increased CO2 emissions were associated with low macrophyte abundance, whereas at high nutrient levels, decreased phytoplankton abundance was linked to increased emissions of CO2 and CH4. In contrast to the observable heat-wave effect, no clear general effect of the long-term temperature treatments could be discerned over the summer, likely because the potential effects of the moderate temperature increase, applied as a press disturbance, were overridden by biotic interactions. This study demonstrates that the role of biotic interactions needs to be considered within the context of global warming on ecosystem processes.",10.1111/fwb.12930,shallow lake,Denmark,56.2334,9.5168,No,Yes,2014-06-19,2014-09-01,,2835,Outdoor,No,4,NA,,Not specified,,Yes,Yes,Not specified,Yes,Yes,Not specified,Yes,Yes,Yes,NP,NE,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7-9; 9-12,7-9; 9-12,NE,NE,"30,2; 31,5",NE,NE,NE,NE,NE,,,"diurnal, seasonal",nutrients,nutrients,macrophyte abuncancd; chla; GHG,,,,

Shading by periphyton and phytoplankton/turbidity plays a major role in this decline, and the competing aquatic primary producers are subject to the complex influence of multiple stressors such as increasing temperatures, nutrient loading and herbicides. Their joint impact has rarely been tested and is difficult to predict due to potentially opposing effects on the different primary producers, their interactions and their grazers. Here, we used 48 mesocosms (2500 L) to simulate shallow lakes dominated by two typical submerged macrophytes, bottom-dwelling Vallisneria denseserrulata and canopy-forming Hydrilla verticillata, and associated food web components. We applied a combination of nutrient loading, continuous warming, heat waves and glyphosate-based herbicides to test how these stressors interactively impact the growth of submerged macrophytes, phytoplankton and periphyton as competing primary producers. Warming or heat waves alone did not affect phytoplankton and periphyton abundance, but negatively influenced the biomass of V. denseserrulata. Nutrient loading alone increased phytoplankton biomass and water turbidity and thus negatively affected submerged macrophyte biomass, particularly for V. denseserrulata, by shading. Glyphosate alone did not affect biomass of each primary producer under ambient temperatures. However, heat waves facilitated phytoplankton growth under combined nutrient loading and glyphosate treatments more than continuous warming. As a consequence, H. yerticillata biomass was lowest under these conditions indicating the potential of multiple stressors for macrophyte decline. Our study demonstrated that multiple stressors interactively alter the biomass of primary producers and their interactions and can eventually lead to a loss of macrophyte communities and shift to phytoplankton dominance. These results show the risks in shallow lakes and ponds in agricultural landscapes and underline the need for multiple stressor studies as a base for their future management.",10.1016/j.envint.2022.107478,pond,China,30.47086,114.35718,Yes,No,2020-06-28,2020-11-25,,2500,Outdoor,Not specified,4,NP,,Not specified,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Not specified,Yes,Yes,NP,NE,Yes,Yes,Not provided,Not provided,Not applicable,3; variable,3; variable,51,NE,NE,NE,NE,NA,NE,NE,,,"diurnal, seasonal",nutrients; herbicide,"nutrients, herbicide, interaction","macrophyte PVI, biomass; phytoplankton abundance, biomass; periphyton",,"phyto abundance only at the end, biomass from chla",coordinates of lake,

Eight moored mesocosms were used to compare natural plankton food web responses (control mesocosms) with three treatments simulating expected future local temperature and UVBR increases, as follows: (1) 3 degrees C increase in water temperature, (2) 20% increase in incident UVBR, and (3) simultaneous 3 degrees C increase in water temperature and 20% increase in incident UVBR. The plankton food web was resistant to elevated UVBR, having only moderate effects on plankton abundances and structure. In contrast, warming induced significant shifts in the plankton food web structure and function. Specifically, the abundance of protozooplankton (ciliates and flagellates) increased and the development time of copepods from nauplii to adults decreased. In the warm mesocosms, the emergence of copepod adult stages midway through the experiment resulted in a decrease in ciliates and consequently in an increase in heterotrophic flagellates. One unexpected result was that warming reduced the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria midway through the experiment. These results indicate a trophic-cascade effect under warming. The increase in adult copepods diminishes ciliates and in turn favors heterotrophic flagellates that consume bacteria.

Twelve mesocosms covering a range of pH(T) (pH on the total hydrogen ion concentration scale) from 8.0 to 7.2, corresponding to a range of CO2 partial pressures (pCO(2)) from 440 to 2900 mu atm, at two temperatures (in situ and +5 degrees C; 10 and 15 degrees C) were monitored during 13 days. All mesocosms were characterized by the rapid development of a diatom bloom dominated by Skeletonema costatum, followed by its decline upon the exhaustion of nitrate and silicic acid. Neither the acidification nor the warming resulted in a significant impact on the abundance of bacteria over the experiment. However, warming the water by 5 degrees C resulted in a significant increase in the average bacterial production (BP) in all 15 degrees C mesocosms as compared to 10 degrees C, with no detectable effect of pCO(2) on BP. Variations in total DMSP (DMSPt = particulate + dissolved DMSP) concentrations tracked the development of the bloom, although the rise in DMSPt persisted for a few days after the peaks in chlorophyll a. Average concentrations of DMSPt were not affected by acidification or warming. Initially low concentrations of DMS (< 1 nmol L-1) increased to reach peak values ranging from 30 to 130 nmol L-1 towards the end of the experiment. Increasing the pCO(2) reduced the averaged DMS concentrations by 66% and 69% at 10 and 15 degrees C, respectively, over the duration of the experiment. On the other hand, a 5 degrees C warming increased DMS concentrations by an average of 240% as compared to in situ temperature, resulting in a positive offset of the adverse pCO(2) impact. Significant positive correlations found between bacterial production and concentrations of DMS throughout our experiment point towards temperature-associated enhancement of bacterial DMSP metabolism as a likely driver of the mitigating effect of warming on the negative impact of acidification on the net production of DMS in the LSLE and potentially the global ocean.",10.5194/bg-16-1167-2019,Estuary,Canada,48.48,68.52,No,No,2014-10-01,2014-10-13,,2600,Indoor,No,3?,meso-eutrophic,,Not specified,NP,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,Not specified,Yes,No,NA,NA,Yes,Yes,Yes,Not provided,Not provided,5,5,3,1,15,16,NE,NE,10,15,,,NP,pH,pH,"chl-a, species biomass/abundance, physiological rate",,"pH, pCO2, chl-a, bacteria abundance and production","Day -5 sept 27, dates extracted from figure 1",

Temperature is an environmental context of strong ecological influence and widespread relevance given global warming trends. Warming should increase per capita predator effects on prey through increases in predator metabolic rate, potentially exacerbating intraspecific differences in ecological effects. Here, we used two populations of the potent pelagic freshwater predator, WesternMosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), to test how experimental pond temperature mediates the differences between their ecological impacts. Mosquitofish introduction induced a strong pelagic trophic cascade, causing a large reduction of crustacean zooplankton biomass, an increase in phytoplankton biomass, and changes to ecosystem-level response variables. Warming (+/- 28 degrees C above unwarmed treatments) exacerbated fish-induced reduction of zooplankton biomass, but moderated the cascade to phytoplankton, primary productivity, and nutrient concentrations. Effects of intraspecific variation were apparent only on zooplankton, and only at warmed environmental temperatures. The traits underlying this divergence may be related to the population source thermal environments. Overall, results show that warming may increase the ecological importance of predator intraspecific variation.

We compared the results with current Canadian Water Quality Guidelines (CWQG) for chronic exposure to chloride.

The loss of this key component can result in turbid conditions and a loss of important ecosystem functions and services, particularly in shallow lakes. Benthivorous fish, which can increase in abundance during eutrophication, can adversely affect macrophytes through physical disturbance, cascading effects on turbidity, suspended and attached algae (phytoplankton and periphyton) and direct consumption. However, whether warming amplifies their effects on macrophytes and can trigger regime shifts remains unexplored. Here, we tested the single and combined effects of warmer water (+4.5 degrees C) and the widespread benthivorous juvenile common carp Cyprinus carpio on two different types of aquatic macrophytes in 24 mesocosms (2,500 L each). We monitored phytoplankton, periphyton, turbidity and the abundance of the submerged curly leafed pondweed Potamogeton crispus and the floating-leaved water chestnut Trapa bispinosa during their growing season. These species dominated successively in spring and summer. Warming alone advanced the growing season of P. crispus by 17 days. Juvenile carp decreased the abundance of the more palatable P. crispus, but promoted the abundance of T. bispinosa, supporting an ecosystem shift to a dominance of floating-leaved macrophytes. Fish also substantially increased water turbidity and the biomass of phytoplankton and periphyton. Warming amplified juvenile carp effects on turbidity and submerged macrophytes, but also decreased the abundance of floating-leaved macrophytes leading to an overall macrophyte decline and increase in water turbidity. Synthesis and applications. Our study provides the first experimental evidence for a warming-induced regime shift from clear-water conditions dominated by submerged or floating/floating-leaved macrophytes to a turbid state in shallow aquatic ecosystems. The regime shift was triggered by the impacts of warming on benthivorous fish (juvenile common carp) rather than on macrophytes.

Temperature treatments consisted of controls that approximated the 9-yr mean daily temperatures for Ninigret and Point Judith Lagoons in Rhode Island (United States) and treatments approximately 4degreesC above and 4degreesC below the controls. Nutrient treatments consisted of the addition of 6 mmol N m(-2) d(-1) and 0.5 mmol P m(-2) d(-1) to mesocosms 4degreesC above and 4degreesC below the 9-yr daily mean. Nutrient enrichment produced marked phytoplankton blooms in both cool and warm treatments during early summer. These were replaced after midsummer by dramatic growths of macroalgal mats of Enteromorpha flexuosa and, to a lesser degree, Cladophora sericea. No phytoplankton blooms were observed in the cool unenriched treatments, but blooms did develop in the mean temperature and warm mesocosms during the second half of the summer that were similar in intensity, though of shorter duration, than those observed earlier in the enriched systems. Macroalgal blooms did not occur in the unenriched mesocosms. Sustained warm water temperatures markedly decreased eelgrass density and belowground production and increased the time interval between the initiation of new leaves, particularly when the biomass of macroalgae was high.

Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotope composition (N-15:N-14, delta N-15 and C-13:C-12, delta C-13) have been widely used to elucidate changes in aquatic ecosystem dynamics created by eutrophication and climate warming, often, however, without accounting for seasonal variation. 2. Here, we aim to determine the factors controlling the stable isotope composition and C:N ratio of seston and periphyton in shallow lakes with contrasting nutrient loadings and climate; for this purpose, we followed the monthly stable isotope composition (c. 1 year) of seston (SES) and periphyton (PER) in 24 mesocosms mimicking shallow lakes with two nutrient treatments (enriched and unenriched) and three temperature scenarios (ambient, +3 and +5 degrees C). 3. Nutrient enrichment and warming had a stronger impact on the delta N-15 and delta C-13 values of seston than on periphyton, and the temporal isotopic variability in both communities was large. 4. delta N-15(PER) did not differ markedly between nutrient treatments, whereas delta N-15(SES) was lower in the enriched mesocosms, possibly reflecting higher N-2-fixation by cyanobacteria. delta N-15(SES) was higher in winter in the heated mesocosms and its dynamics was linked with that of NH4-N, whereas delta N-15(PER) showed a stronger association with NO3-N delta N-15(SES) demonstrated a positive relationship with mean monthly temperature, indicating less isotope fractionation among autotrophs when production increased. 5. delta C-13(SES) was lowest in the enriched mesocosms during winter, whereas delta C-13(PER) did not differ between nutrient treatments. delta C-13(SES) and delta C-13(PER) were positively related to pH, likely reflecting a pH-induced differential access to dissolved carbon species in the primary producers. The positive delta C-13-temperature relationship suggested less fractionation of CO2 and HCO3- and/or larger use of HCO3- at higher temperatures. 6. The C:N ratios varied seasonally and the differences between the enriched and unenriched mesocosms were stronger for seston than for periphyton. Particularly, the C:N-SES ratios did not indicate deficiencies in N as opposed to the C: N-PER ratios, supporting the observed changes in delta N-15 and suggesting that seston and periphyton have access to different sources of nutrients. We did not observe any clear effect of temperature warming on the C:N ratios. 7.

Reduced nitrogen availability due to accelerated denitrification at higher temperatures or in response to reduced N loadings aimed to reduce the eutrophication may affect periphyton biomass and composition, to compensate for the low N availability (e.g. promoting N2-fixing). We analysed periphyton responses to N decline in 12 eutrophic shallow lake mesocosms during one year of low N compared to high N, under three temperature scenarios: ambient, A2 IPCC scenario and A2 increased by 50%. We used two submerged macrophytes (Potamogeton crispus and Elodea canadensis) and artificial imitations of these as substrates for periphyton growth. Nitrogen decline increased periphyton biomass and induced compositional changes irrespective of season, plant type, and temperature. Periphyton biomass was negatively associated to phytoplankton and positively to plant complexity. Warmer scenarios negatively affected periphyton exclusively at high N loadings. Low N conditions were associated with lower periphyton taxonomic richness, lower N2-fixing cyanobacteria biovolume and increased biovolume of large-sized chlorophytes and non-N2-fixing cyanobacteria. Our results suggest that low N conditions promoted periphyton due to a more efficient use of nutrients and improved light conditions resulting from lower phytoplankton biomass and contrasting effects of temperature. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/s10750-021-04755-y,shallow lake,Denmark,56.23,9.52,Yes,Yes,2017-01-01,2020-01-01,,2800,Not specified,No,4,eutrophic,,Yes,"Weekly addition of 7mg P m-2 day-1 and 27,1 mg N m-2 day-1, with Ca(NO3)2 and Na2HPO4 to a constant loading of 54mg P and 538mg N per mesocosm",Yes,Not specified,Yes,Yes,Yes,Not specified,Yes,Yes,No,NA,NA,Not provided,Not provided,Yes,Not applicable,Not applicable,3; 4.5,"Ambient, A2 IPCC scenario (ca. 3 °C) and A2 increased by 50% (ca. 4.5 °C)",NP,NP,NE,21,NP,NP,NP,NP,,Diurnal and seasonal,"diel, seasonal",Fish; macrophytes; nutrients,"nitrogen, plant type (natural, artificial)","chl-a, group biomass/abundance, community metrics, physiological rate",,,"continuous experiment since 2003, 2 temperature treatments - maybe need to have 2 rows?",

However, phytoplankton dominance is less desirable due to lower biodiversity and poorer ecosystem function and services. In this study, we combined a microcosm experiment with a process-based model to test three hypotheses: 1) agricultural run-off (ARO), consisting of nitrate and a mixture of organic pesticides and copper, differentially affects primary producers and enhances the risk of regime shifts, 2) warming increases the risk of an ARO-induced regime shift to phytoplankton dominance and 3) custom-tailored process-based models support mechanistic understanding of experimental results through scenario comparison. Experimentally exposing primary producers to a gradient of nitrate and pesticides at 22°C and 26°C supported the first two hypotheses. ARO had direct negative effects on macrophytes, while phytoplankton gained from warming and indirect effects of ARO like a reduction in the competitive pressure exerted by other groups. We used the process-based model to test eight different scenarios. The best qualitative fit between modeled and observed responses was reached only when taking community adaptation and organism acclimation into account. Our results highlight the importance of considering such processes when attempting to predict the effects of multiple stressors on natural ecosystems.

An in situ mesocosm experiment was performed in a Mediterranean lagoon for 33 days. Three mesocosms were used as controls following the natural temperature of the lagoon. In three others, two HWs of + 5 °C compared to the controls were applied from experimental day (d) 1 to d5 (HW1) and from d11 to d15 (HW2). High-frequency data of oxygen, chlorophyll-a (chl-a), temperature, salinity and light from sensors immersed in all mesocosms were used to calculate gross primary production (GPP), respiration (R) and phytoplankton growth (µ) and loss (L) rates. Nutrients and phytoplankton community structure from pigments were also analyzed. HW1 significantly increased GPP, R, chl-a, µ and L by 7 to 38%. HW2 shifted the system toward heterotrophy by only enhancing R. Thus, the effects of the first HW resulted in the attenuation of those of a second HW on phytoplankton processes, but not on community respiration, which was strongly regulated by temperature. In addition, natural phytoplankton succession from diatoms to haptophytes was altered by both HWs as cyanobacteria and chlorophytes were favored at the expense of haptophytes. These results indicate that HWs have pronounced effects on Mediterranean plankton communities. © 2023, The Author(s).",10.1038/s41598-023-35311-4,lagoon,France,43.41,3.69,No,No,2022-04-28,2022-05-31,,1700,In-Situ,No,3,oligotrophic,,Not specified,,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,"Extreme short-lived warming events lasting from several days to months (Hobday et al, 2018)",2,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,5,5°C above control ,0,2,NE,4,5,12,17.8°C,21°C,,Natural,,NA,,"chl-a, group biomass/abundance, community metrics, physiological rate",,,"2 heat waves, mixing naturally with winds and currents of the lagoon, only sensor data recoded during recovery period",

Submerged macrophyte meadows support benthic microorganisms and provide the trophic network with non-trophic relationships. Multi-interaction network analysis disentangles how these systems respond to changes in global-change-related factors. We examined whether (i) populations’ responses to such disturbances are habitat-dependent, and (ii) if whole-community configurations are different. We performed an indoor-mesocosm experiment (“control” plus two disturbed scenarios: enhanced ultraviolet radiation (UVR) or temperature), recreating shallow freshwater ecosystems. We assessed the population-nodes’ carbon biomass, their resistance and resilience to the disturbances, and global- and node-scale structural parameters of the multi-interaction network. Under the UVR-scenario, the phytoplankton C-biomass (from pelagic and within-meadow habitats) was significantly the highest, with mixotrophs dominating. Warming favoured macrophyte growth and significantly increased the network’s size and nestedness, with zooplanktonic herbivores playing a connector role. The within-meadow and benthic habitats’ nodes were highly influential for the network, whatever the scenario. The benthic nodes were the most resistant to the disturbances. Therefore, a phytoplankton- and a macrophyte-dominated configuration was attained under UVR and warming scenarios, respectively. The macrophyte meadows, and the community linked to them, were pivotal in the achievement of these contrasting configurations. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/s10750-020-04359-y,lagoon,Spain,39.48,-0.36,No,No,NP,NP,,170,Indoor,Not specified,4,,,Not specified,,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,NA,NA,No,No,Yes,Not provided,Not provided,4,4°C above control ,0,0,26,60,NP,NP,22,26,,Diurnal,,UVR; PAR,,"chl-a, species biomass/abundance, group biomass/abundance",,,"Experiment lasted 60 days.

We employed an outdoor mesocosm experiment during spring and summer to investigate the combined effects of gradually increasing warming and brownification perturbations on the phytoplankton community structure (biodiversity and composition) and functioning (biomass). While we did not observe overall significant treatment effects on total phytoplankton biomasses, we show that predicted increases in warming and brownification can reduce biodiversity considerably, occasionally up to 90% of Shannon diversity estimates. Our results demonstrate that the loss of biodiversity is driven by the dominance of mixotrophic algae (Dinobryon and Cryptomonas), whereas several other phytoplankton taxa may be temporarily displaced from the community, including Cyclotella, Desmodesmus, Monoraphidium, Tetraedron, Nitzschia and Golenkinia. The observed loss of biodiversity coincided with an increase in bacterial production providing resources for potential mixotrophs along the gradient of warming and brownification. This coupling between bacterial production and mixotrophs was likely a major cause behind the competitive displacement of obligate phototrophs and supports evidence for the importance of consumer–prey dynamics in shaping environmental impacts on phytoplankton communities. We conclude that warming and brownification are likely to cause a profound loss of biodiversity by indirectly affecting competitive interactions among phytoplankton taxa. Importantly, our results did not show an abrupt loss of biodiversity; instead the reduction in taxa richness levelled off after exceeding a threshold of warming and brownification. These results exemplify the complex nonlinear responses of biodiversity to environmental perturbations and provide further insights for predicting biodiversity patterns to the future warming and brownification of freshwaters. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/fwb.13027,shallow lake,Sweden,55.70,13.20,Yes,No,2013-04-04,2013-07-23,,400,Outdoor,No,4,eutrophic lake,,Yes,"around 30–40 lg/L of total phosphorous), we added 1 ml of commercially available plant nutrients (Blomstra  vaxtnaring, Cederroth, Upplands Visby, Sweden; 50.1 g/L total nitrogen and 10.0 g/L total phosphorous) every second week to all enclosures.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Not specified,Yes,Yes,No,NA,NA,Not provided,Yes,Yes,Not provided,Not provided,1-5,1°C to +5°C levels,0,0,NE,111,NP,NP,NE,NE,,Natural and seasonal,seasonal,Fish; nutrients; brownification,brownification,"chl-a, species biomass/abundance, group biomass/abundance, community metrics, physiological rate",,,,

To investigate their direct and indirect effects on a near-natural plankton community, a multiple-stressor approach is needed. Hence, we set up mesocosms in a full-factorial design to study the effects of both warming and high CO2 on a Baltic Sea autumn plankton community, concentrating on the impacts on microzooplankton (MZP). MZP abundance, biomass, and species composition were analysed over the course of the experiment. We observed that warming led to a reduced time-lag between the phytoplankton bloom and an MZP biomass maximum. MZP showed a significantly higher growth rate and an earlier biomass peak in the warm treatments while the biomass maximum was not affected. Increased pCO2 did not result in any significant effects on MZP biomass, growth rate, or species composition irrespective of the temperature, nor did we observe any significant interactions between CO2 and temperature. We attribute this to the high tolerance of this estuarine plankton community to fluctuations in pCO2, often resulting in CO2 concentrations higher than the predicted end-of-century concentration for open oceans. In contrast, warming can be expected to directly affect MZP and strengthen its coupling with phytoplankton by enhancing its grazing pressure. # International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2015.",10.1093/icesjms/fsv198,"coastal (fjord, bay)",Germany,54.33,10.18,No,No,2012-10-22,2012-11-12,,1400,Indoor,No,3,,,Not specified,,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,Not specified,Yes,No,NA,NA,No,No,Yes,Not provided,Not provided,3,3,3,3,15,21,NP,NP,12,15,,,diel,CO2,"lower temp (9C), CO2","chl-a, species biomass/abundance, group biomass/abundance",,,,

In freshwater and marine environments, parasites play a crucial role in controlling plankton population dynamics. Infection of phytoplankton populations will cause a transfer of carbon and nutrients into parasites, which may change the type of food available for higher trophic levels. Some phytoplankton species are inedible to zooplankton, and the termination of their population by parasites may liberate otherwise unavailable carbon and nutrients. Phytoplankton spring blooms often consist of large diatoms inedible for zooplankton, but the zoospores of their fungal parasites may serve as a food source for this higher trophic level. Here, we investigated the impact of warming on the fungal infection of a natural phytoplankton spring bloom and followed the response of a zooplankton community. Experiments were performed in ca. 1000 L indoor mesocosms exposed to a controlled seasonal temperature cycle and a warm (+4 °C) treatment in the period from March to June 2014. The spring bloom was dominated by the diatom Synedra. At the peak of infection over 40% of the Synedra population was infected by a fungal parasite (i.e. a chytrid) in both treatments. Warming did not affect the onset of the Synedra bloom, but accelerated its termination. Peak population density of Synedra tended to be lower in the warm treatments. Furthermore, Synedra carbon: phosphorus stoichiometry increased during the bloom, particularly in the control treatments. This indicates enhanced phosphorus limitation in the control treatments, which may have constrained chytrid development. Timing of the rotifer Keratella advanced in the warm treatments and closely followed chytrid infections. The chytrids' zoospores may thus have served as an alternative food source to Keratella. Our study thus emphasizes the importance of incorporating not only nutrient limitation and grazing, but also parasitism in understanding the response of plankton communities towards global warming. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",10.1111/gcb.13095,pond,Netherlands,51.99,5.67,No,No,2014-03-03,2014-06-02,,988,Indoor,No,4,meso-eutrophic,,Not specified,,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Not specified,Not specified,Yes,Yes,No,NA,NA,No,Not provided,Yes,Not provided,Not provided,4,4,2,NA,NP,NP,NP,NP,NA,NA,,,NA,,,"chl-a, group biomass/abundance, community metrics, stoichiometry",,,no temperature chart provided,

Concurrently, supply of humic substances from terrestrial runoff is expected to increase, resulting in darker watercolor (""brownification"") of aquatic ecosystems. Using a multi-seasonal, low trophic state mesocosm experiment, we investigated how higher water temperature and brownification affect plankton community composition, phenology, and functioning. We tested the hypothesis that higher water temperature (+3°C) and brownification will, a) cause plankton community composition to shift toward small sized phytoplankton and cyanobacteria, and, b) extend the length of the growing season entailing higher phytoplankton production later in the season. We demonstrate that the 3°C increase of water temperature favored the growth of heterotrophic bacteria and small sized autotrophic picophytoplankton cells with significantly higher primary production during warmer fall periods. However, 3X darker water (effect of brownification) caused no significant changes in the plankton community composition or functioning relative to control conditions. Our findings reveal that increased temperature change plankton community structure by favoring smaller sized species proliferation (autotrophic phytoplankton and small size cladocerans), and increase primary productivity and community turnover. Finally, results of this multi-seasonal experiment suggest that warming by 3°C in aquatic ecosystems of low trophic state may cause planktonic food web functioning to become more dominated by fast growing, r-trait species (i.e., small sizes and rapid development). © 2015 Rasconi et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",10.1371/journal.pone.0140449,Alpine lake,Austria,47.85,15.02,Yes,No,2013-04-18,2013-12-12,,400,Outdoor,No,6,mesotrophic,,Yes,"weekly, 3 μg P from K2PO4 and 45 μg N

To investigate the effects of two emerging environmental threats (ocean acidification and warming) on marine DMS production, we performed a large-scale perturbation experiment in a coastal environment. At both ambient temperature and ∼2 °C warmer, an increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) in seawater (160-830 ppmv pCO2) favored the growth of large diatoms, which outcompeted other phytoplankton species in a natural phytoplankton assemblage and reduced the growth rate of smaller, DMSP-rich phototrophic dinoflagellates. This decreased the grazing rate of heterotrophic dinoflagellates (ubiquitous micrograzers), resulting in reduced DMS production via grazing activity.

Filamentous green algae (FGA) may represent an alternative state in high-nutrient shallow temperate lakes. Furthermore, a clear water state is sometimes associated with the dominance of FGA; however, the mechanisms involved remain uncertain. 2. We hypothesised that FGA may promote a clear water state by directly suppressing phytoplankton growth, mostly via the release of allelochemicals, and that this interaction may be affected by temperature. 3. We examined the relationships between FGA, phytoplanktonic chlorophyll a concentrations and zooplankton in a series of mesocosms (2.8m3) mimicking enriched shallow ponds now and in a future warmer climate (0 and c.5°C above ambient temperatures). We then tested the potential allelopathic effects of FGA (Cladophora sp. and Spirogyra sp.) on phytoplankton using several short-term microcosms and laboratory experiments. 4. Mesocosms with FGA evidenced lower phytoplanktonic chlorophyll a concentrations than those without. Zooplankton and zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratios did not differ between mesocosms with and without FGA, suggesting that grazing was not responsible for the negative effects on phytoplanktonic biomass (chlorophyll a). 5. Our field microcosm experiments demonstrated that FGA strongly suppressed the growth of natural phytoplankton at non-limiting nutrient conditions and regardless of phytoplankton initial concentrations or micronutrients addition. Furthermore, we found that the negative effect of FGA on phytoplankton growth increased up to 49% under high incubation temperatures. The experiment performed using FGA filtrates confirmed that the inhibitory effect of FGA on phytoplankton may be attributed to allelochemicals. 6. Our results suggest that FGA control of phytoplankton growth may be an important mechanism for stabilising clear water in shallow temperate lakes dominated by FGA and that FGA may play a larger role when lakes get warmer. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02521.x,shallow lake,Denmark,56.23,9.52,Yes,Yes,2004-XX-XX,2009-XX-XX,,2800,Outdoor,No,4,eutrophic,high nutrient levels,Yes,weekly dosing of N and P (N : P molar ratio of 88),Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Not specified,Not specified,Yes,No,NA,NA,Not provided,Not provided,Not provided,Not provided,Not provided,5,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,"chl-a, group biomass/abundance",,,diff experiment dates for pyhto and zoo.  2004-2009 for chla data set.,

On the basis of modelling, monitoring and experimental data, we demonstrate that community responses to global change are determined by food-chain length and that the top trophic level, and every second level below, will benefit from climate change, whereas the levels in between will suffer. Hence, phytoplankton, and thereby algal blooms, will benefit from climate change in three-, but not in two-trophic-level systems. Moreover, we show that both phytoplankton (resource) and zooplankton (consumer) advance their spring peak abundances similarly in response to a 3°C temperature increase; that is, there is no support for a consumer/resource mismatch in a future climate scenario. However, in contrast to other taxa, cyanobacteria - known as toxin-producing nuisance phytoplankton3 - benefit from a higher temperature and humic content irrespective of the food-chain composition. Our results are mirrored in natural ecosystems. By mechanistically merging present food-chain theory with large-scale environmental and climate changes, we provide a powerful framework for predicting and understanding future aquatic ecosystems and their provision of ecosystem services and water resources.

Ongoing and future climatic change may alter the performance of native and non-native species and their biotic interactions. In the northern hemisphere, expected climate changes include warmer temperatures and higher precipitation, the latter of which may increase dissolved organic carbon (humic) concentrations, resulting in browner water in aquatic ecosystems (brownification). We tested the effects of elevated temperature (3 °C) and brownification on native and non-native aquatic plant production in mesocosms over 56 days. Elodea canadensis, an aquatic invasive plant, had higher relative growth rate in terms of both length and weight, as well as higher weight to length ratio when grown in brown versus clear water; E. canadensis did not respond to temperature treatments. Different functional groups of native producers (phytoplankton, periphyton, macrophytes) showed different relationships to temperature and brownification treatments, with the macrophyte response being most notable because it was opposite to that of E. canadensis. Native macrophytes decreased in biomass in browner water, where they represented about 40 % of total biomass compared to 85 % in clear water. In regression analyses, E. canadensis length RGR was best predicted only by water color treatment, but biomass RGR and biomass per length were inversely correlated with native macrophyte biomass, which is consistent with competition. Our results unexpectedly showed water brownification to have more influence on lake invasion than climate warming at this temperature regime. Two pathways emerged for climate to interact with biological invasions in structuring novel communities: directly, if non-native species respond positively to climate change, and indirectly through species interactions, for instance, because water brownification impairs growth of native macrophytes and reduces biotic resistance to invasion. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",10.1007/s10530-012-0216-y,shallow lake,Sweden,55.70,13.20,No,No,2010-07-19,2010-09-08,,400,Outdoor,No,6,NP,humic experiment,Not specified,,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Not specified,Not specified,Yes,No,NA,NA,Not provided,Yes,Yes,Not provided,Not provided,3,3,NA,NE,NE,NE,NA,NA,NE,NE,,,seasonal,brownification,brownification,"chl-a, group biomass/abundance, trait",,,"56 days long, dates not specified, taken from figure",

DMSP is converted to the climatically active dimethylsulfide (DMS), which is transferred to the atmosphere and photochemically oxidized to sulfate aerosols, leading to increases in planetary albedo and cooling of the Earth's atmosphere. A shipboard incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of increased temperature and pCO2 on the algal community structure of the North Atlantic spring bloom and their subsequent impact on particulate and dissolved DMSP concentrations (DMSPp and DMSPd). Under 'greenhouse' conditions (elevated pCO2; 690 ppm) and elevated temperature (ambient + 4°C), coccolithophorid and pelagophyte abundances were significantly higher than under control conditions (390 ppm CO2 and ambient temperature). This shift in phytoplankton community structure also resulted in an increase in DMSPpconcentrations and DMSPp:chl a ratios. There were also increases in DMSP-lyase activity and biomass-normalized DMSP-lyase activity under 'greenhouse' conditions. Concentrations of DMSPd decreased in the 'greenhouse' treatment relative to the control. This decline is thought to be partly due to changes in the microzooplankton community structure and decreased grazing pressure under 'greenhouse' conditions. The increases in DMSPp in the high temperature and greenhouse treatments support the CLAW hypothesis; the declines in DMSPd do not. © Inter-Research 2009.",10.3354/meps08135,off-shore/fully marine,North Atlantic Ocean,57.58,15.32,No,No,2005-06-20,2005-07-04,,2.7,Indoor,Not specified,6,NP,low nutrient concentration,Yes,"nitrate and phosphate were added to both the initial incubation bottles and dilution media to give final concentrations of 5 and 0.31 µmol l–1, respectively",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,Not specified,Yes,No,NA,NA,Not provided,Not provided,Not provided,Not provided,Not provided,4,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12,16,,,NA,CO2,CO2,"chl-a, trait",,,,

A common pattern observed is that aggregated functions at the community level are more stable than community composition, which is likely the result of functional compensatory dynamics driven by interspecific differences in response to environmental change. However, the mechanisms by which these patterns emerge remain largely unexplored. Here we investigated in a mesocosm experiment for four weeks the compositional and functional responses of edible phytoplankton (<64 mu m) and cladoceran zooplankton communities to climate warming (a constant increase of +3.5 degrees C plus heat wave) and eutrophication (nutrient additions) from a size-based perspective. Our results show that warming increases small-sized taxa and decreases large-sized taxa within both phytoplankton and zooplankton community composition. We found that such opposite responses of different-sized taxa contributed to the stability of planktonic community functions and thereby resulted in a decoupling between compositional and functional changes. We also found that nutrient additions increased the abundance of all-sized algal taxa, while phytoplankton community function remained stable. Nutrient additions did not alter the zooplankton community, neither compositionally nor functionally. Under the combined stress of warming and nutrient additions, the compositional and functional responses of planktonic communities were mainly driven by warming. In a broader perspective, our findings reveal a size-dependent compensation mechanism and suggest that functional stability relies on compensatory effects among different-sized taxa, and it is therefore important that communities host a large range of taxa differing in size to withstand an increasingly more variable environment in the future.",10.1002/ecs2.4626,shallow lake,China,30.483333,113.2,No,No,2021-07-26,2021-08-23,,2500,Not specified,No,6,NP,,No,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Not specified,Yes,No,NA,NA,No,Not provided,Yes,No,No,3.5,3.5,NA,NA,3.5,29,NA,NA,32,31,,,natural fluctuations,nutrients,Nutrient addition (N and P added in ratio of 10:1),Group biomass/abundance,,,Phytoplankton defined as (<64um),

An outdoor freshwater mesocosm experiment was used to determine how warming of similar to 4 degrees C would affect the size, biomass and taxonomic structure of planktonic communities. Warming increased the steepness of the community size spectrum by increasing the prevalence of small organisms, primarily within the phytoplankton assemblage and it also reduced the mean and maximum size of phytoplankton by approximately one order of magnitude. The observed shifts in phytoplankton size structure were reflected in changes in phytoplankton community composition, though zooplankton taxonomic composition was unaffected by warming. Furthermore, warming reduced community biomass and total phytoplankton biomass, although zooplankton biomass was unaffected. This resulted in an increase in the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio in the warmed mesocosms, which could be explained by faster turnover within the phytoplankton assemblages. Overall, warming shifted the distribution of phytoplankton size towards smaller individuals with rapid turnover and low standing biomass, resulting in a reorganization of the biomass structure of the food webs.

We performed a 16-month factorial experimental manipulation of warming, nutrient enrichment, and predator presence in replicated freshwater pond mesocosms to test their independent and interactive impacts. Warming strengthened trophic cascades from fish to primary producers, and it decreased the impact of eutrophication on the mean and temporal variation of phytoplankton biomass. These impacts varied seasonally, with higher temperatures leading to stronger trophic cascades in winter and weaker algae blooms under eutrophication in summer.

For example, climate warming and nitrogen deposition both increasingly affect ecosystems at high elevations. We hypothesized that the net impact of warming and nitrogen on alpine plankton differs between consumers and producers because of the greater environmental sensitivity of higher trophic levels. Also, we expected that habitat conditions would mediate the responses of plankton to these two stressors as sediments function as ecological buffers against environmental change. These hypotheses were tested in a growth chamber by applying temperature (8 vs. 15 degrees C) and nitrogen (200 vs. 1000 mu g N L-1) treatments to a planktonic alpine community in the presence and absence of sediments obtained from Pipit Lake, Banff National Park, Alberta. A significant nitrogen-temperature interaction affected phytoplankton abundance because the positive effect of fertilization depended on warming. Warming also amplified the effect of nitrogen on herbivores while suppressing the fecundity of omnivores. The presence of sediments suppressed the positive effect of warming on herbivores, but stimulated omnivores.

Two different temperature (Delta 0 A degrees C and Delta 6 A degrees C) and three light scenarios (62, 57 and 49 % of the natural surface light intensity on sunny days), mimicking increasing cloudiness as predicted for warmer winters in the Baltic Sea region, were simulated. By combining experimental and modeling approaches, we were able to test for a potential dietary mismatch between phytoplankton and zooplankton. Two general predator-prey models, one representing the community as a tri-trophic food chain and one as a 5-guild food web were applied to test for the consequences of different temperature sensitivities of heterotrophic components of the plankton. During the experiments, we observed reduced time-lags between the peaks of phytoplankton and protozoan biomass in response to warming. Microzooplankton peak biomass was reached by 2.5 day A degrees C-1 earlier and occurred almost synchronously with biomass peaks of phytoplankton in the warm mesocosms (Delta 6 A degrees C). The peak magnitudes of microzooplankton biomass remained unaffected by temperature, and growth rates of microzooplankton were higher at Delta 6 A degrees C (mu(a dagger 0 A degrees C) = 0.12 day(-1) and mu(a dagger 6 A degrees C) = 0.25 day(-1)). Furthermore, warming induced a shift in microzooplankton phenology leading to a faster species turnover and a shorter window of microzooplankton occurrence. Moderate differences in the light levels had no significant effect on the time-lags between autotrophic and heterotrophic biomass and on the timing, biomass maxima and growth rate of microzooplankton biomass. Both models predicted reduced time-lags between the biomass peaks of phytoplankton and its predators (both microzooplankton and copepods) with warming. The reduction of time-lags increased with increasing Q(10) values of copepods and protozoans in the tritrophic food chain. Indirect trophic effects modified this pattern in the 5-guild food web. Our study shows that instead of a mismatch, warming might lead to a stronger match between protist grazers and their prey altering in turn the transfer of matter and energy toward higher trophic levels.",10.1007/s00227-012-1947-0,"coastal (fjord, bay)",Germany,54.18357875503912,7.890973103248145,No,No,2008-02-06,2008-03-26,,1400,Indoor,No,4,NP,,No,,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,Not specified,Yes,No,NA,NA,No,No,Yes,No,No,6,6,NP,NP,8.7,49,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,Natural fluctiations,light levels,"Three irradiance treatments: 49%, 57%, and 62% of sea surface irradiance in on sunny days","species biomass/abundance, group biomass/abundance",,"Total phytoplankton biomass, dinoflagellate biomass, mean phytoplankton biomass, biomass of dominant heterotrophic dinoflagellate Protoperidinium bipes",,

Using an outdoor mesocosm experiment at 2900 m above-sea level along the Colorado Front Range, we investigated the individual and combined effects of realistic increases in temperature (ambient versus 2.4 degrees C increase) and nitrogen concentrations (three levels) on lake plankton and hydrochemistry. Relative to the low temperature treatment, enhanced temperatures decreased the overall density of Daphnia pulicaria by similar to 40% and of gravid females specifically by similar to 20%. Increased nitrogen also reduced Daphnia density, especially in the low-temperature treatments, leading to a significant nitrogen-by-temperature interaction. The calanoid copepod Hesperodiaptomus shoshone, in contrast, was unaffected by experimental manipulations of temperature and nitrogen, and declined in abundance over time regardless of treatment. Chlorophyll-a increased to a maximum in week 4 and was unaffected by the temperature manipulation, suggesting that observed effects on Daphnia were likely direct physiological responses to warming rather than bottom-up effects. Nitrate additions caused transient increases in chlorophyll-a, which converged across treatments by the end of the study as nutrients were assimilated. Nitrogen additions also led to progressive increases in dissolved organic carbon concentrations throughout the experiment. Our results suggest that warming has the potential to reduce zooplankton production, consistent with observed decreases in large-bodied Daphnia density with decreasing elevation in the Colorado Rockies.

However, our current understanding of the mechanisms governing community resistance to and recovery from extreme temperature events is still rudimentary. The spatial insurance hypothesis postulates that diverse regional species pools can buffer ecosystem functioning against local disturbances through the immigration of better-adapted taxa. Yet, experimental evidence for such predictions from multi-trophic communities and pulse-type disturbances, like heatwaves, is largely missing. We performed an experimental mesocosm study to test whether species dispersal from natural lakes prior to a simulated heatwave could increase the resistance and recovery of plankton communities. As the buffering effect of dispersal may differ among trophic groups, we independently manipulated the dispersal of organisms from lower (phytoplankton) and higher (zooplankton) trophic levels. The experimental heatwave suppressed total community biomass by having a strong negative effect on zooplankton biomass, probably due to a heat-induced increase in metabolic costs, resulting in weaker top-down control on phytoplankton. While zooplankton dispersal did not alleviate the negative heatwave effects on zooplankton biomass, phytoplankton dispersal enhanced biomass recovery at the level of primary producers, providing partial evidence for spatial insurance. The differential responses to dispersal may be linked to the much larger regional species pool of phytoplankton than of zooplankton.

Results: We coupled molecular tools (18S rRNA gene sequencing and fingerprinting) with microscope-based identification and counting to experimentally investigate the short-term responses of small eukaryotes (<6 mu m; from a coastal Mediterranean lagoon) to a warming treatment (+3 degrees C) and UVB radiation increases (+20%) at two different nutrient levels. Interestingly, the increase in temperature resulted in higher pigmented eukaryotes abundances and in community structure changes clearly illustrated by molecular analyses. For most of the phylogenetic groups, some rearrangements occurred at the OTUs level even when their relative proportion (microscope counting) did not change significantly. Temperature explained almost 20% of the total variance of the small eukaryote community structure (while UVB explained only 8.4%). However, complex cumulative effects were detected. Some antagonistic or non additive effects were detected between temperature and nutrients, especially for Dinophyceae and Cryptophyceae.

To determine how the effects of these changes on freshwater communities interact, we ran a month-long factorial mesocosm experiment, in which we manipulated water temperature (heated, ambient) and pCO2 (preindustrial, ambient, future). We found that the total phytoplankton biomass responded positively to the pCO2 and temperature treatments but no interactive effects were detected. Green algae were positively affected by temperature and, over the course of the experiment, responded to pCO2 first positively, then negatively. Heterokonts, on the other hand, were unaffected by temperature but responded positively to pCO2. pCO2 enrichment also led to increases in seston C : N stoichiometry, although the experiment ended before we could observe any effects of pCO2 on the zooplankton community composition. Warming caused shifts in zooplankton community composition, primarily through higher abundances of the cladoceran Bosmina longirostris and the rotifer Conochilus unicornis, and lower abundances of the rotifer Polyarthra vulgaris. We found that, in contrast to the effects of temperature, which can be explained by temperature-dependent plankton growth curves, the responses of algal groups to pCO2 enrichment were difficult to anticipate, despite the availability of priors from previous pCO2 enrichment experiments in the same lake mesocosms. We conclude that climate change-induced increases in aquatic pCO2 and temperatures are likely to affect pelagic ecosystems, though further research in freshwater systems is needed before generalized claims regarding the simple and interactive effects of pCO2 can be made. © 2023 The Authors.

Warming increases metabolic rates of animals, plants, and microbes, accelerating their use of energy and materials, their population growth, and interaction rates. At a much larger biological scale, warming accelerates ecosystem-level processes, elevating fluxes of carbon and oxygen between biota and the atmosphere. Although these general effects of temperature at finer and broader biological scales are widely observed, they can lead to contradictory predictions for how warming affects the structure and function of ecological communities at the intermediate scale of biological organization. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that the presence of predators and their associated species interactions modify the temperature dependence of net ecosystem oxygen production and respiration. We tracked a series of independent freshwater ecosystems (370 L) over 9 weeks, and we found that at higher temperatures, cascading effects of predators on zooplankton prey and algae were stronger than at lower temperatures. When grazing was weak or absent, standing phytoplankton biomass declined by 85%–95% (<1-fold) over the temperature gradient (19–30 ˚C), and by 3-fold when grazers were present and lacked predators. These temperature-dependent species interactions and consequent community biomass shifts occurred without signs of species loss or community collapse, and only modestly affected the temperature dependence of net ecosystem oxygen fluxes. The exponential increases in net ecosystem oxygen production and consumption were relatively insensitive to differences in trophic interactions among ecosystems. Furthermore, monotonic declines in phytoplankton standing stock suggested no threshold effects of warming across systems. We conclude that local changes in community structure, including temperature-dependent trophic cascades, may be compatible with prevailing and predictable effects of temperature on ecosystem functions related to fundamental effects of temperature on metabolism. © 2019 Garzke et al.",10.1371/journal.pbio.2006806,lake (not specified),Canada,49.247778,-132.2325,No,No,2012-07-05,2012-09-06,,370,Outdoor,No,0 (gradient design),NP,,No,,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,Not specified,Yes,No,NA,NA,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,0-10,0-10,NA,NP,34.4,1,NA,NA,26.5,16.11,,,Natural fluctuations.

We tested the hypothesis that in - creased temperature (+3°C) will offset algal growth suppression by UV-B (78% UV-B increase) using duplicate mesocosm experiments containing natural phytoplankton assemblages. The re - sponse of the entire phytoplankton community, in terms of HPLC pigment-based phytoplankton bio mass, community composition (CHEMTAX), xanthophyll cycles photoprotection and quantum yield of photosystem II (the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence: Fv/Fm), showed a significant influence of temperature (negative on small phytoplanktonic cells, <5 -m, and positive on larger diatoms) but only after the peak of the diatom bloom, when nutrients became limited. Interactions between temperature and UV-B treatments were significant only for small cells during post-bloom; UV-B induced an increase in phytoplankton biomass at the normal temperature but had no effect at warmer temperatures. Enhancing UV-B delayed the bloom slightly under the normal temperature and spread it over a longer period of time, with no sign of major cellular damage. Our re sults do not support the tested hypothesis, and they suggest that temperature plays a greater role than UV-B radiation in structuring phytoplankton communities, possibly favouring diatoms rather than small cells in a warmer climate scenario.

In order to study the combined effect of temperature and UVB increase, on the phytoplankton community in the Saint Lawrence Estuary, duplicates of four different treatments were applied to 2m 3 mesocosms to simulate an overall 3°C and a 77.8% UVB increase, and combined. Samples were collected every 6h over 10days and the phytoplankton community was then analysed using a conventional flow cytometer and a Cytosense flow cytometer. Flow cytometry distinguished 9 clusters (Pico, Nano I, C3, C4, CHAINS, C6, C7 and C8) of cells sharing similar optical properties with average sizes varying from 1.3μm up to 101μm for chain forming cells. Compared to untreated enclosures, the high UVB treatment induced lower cell abundances (up to -40%) for clusters Pico, Nano I, C4, CHAINS and C7, followed by an unexpected cell abundance increase in all the clusters during the last 3days of the experiment (up to 46%). This increase was sustained by faster calculated periodicities of the cell optical characteristics and abundances, linked to a shorter cell cycle. In the samples from the high temperature treatment mesocosms, a positive delay was observed for the cell abundance increase in clusters CHAINS, C6 and C8, combined with higher average abundance values (up to 67% with respect to untreated mesocosms). During the last 3days of the experiment, abundances decreased compared to the values observed in the high UVB mesocosms, with a slower trend in the periodicities, suggesting that high temperature inhibits the cell cycle. The combined temperature and UVB treatment emphasized the effects observed under high temperature treatments, maintaining temperature positive effects (i.e. higher abundances) on clusters C3, CHAINS, C6 and C8 suggesting a compensation from the positive temperature effects over the negative (i.e. lower abundances) UVB effects. Increasing temperature induced a negative effect on the abundance of clusters C4 and C7. In this case, trends in C6 and C8 cell periodicities were faster than under normal conditions while Nano I, C4 and C7 cycles were slower. Cells<3μm were negatively affected by the combined exposure (up to -55% compared to untreated mesocosms) while most of the larger cells were positively affected (up to 75% compared to untreated mesocosms), suggesting a shift to an herbivorous food web (sensu Legendre and Rassoulzadegan, 1995).

To study the effects of future global change on these phytoplankton and the biogeochemical cycles they mediate, a shipboard continuous culture experiment (Ecostat) was conducted in June 2005 during this transition period. Four treatments were examined: (1) 12°C and 390 ppm CO2 (ambient control), (2) 12°C and 690 ppm CO2 (high pCO2), (3) 16°C and 390 ppm CO2 (high temperature), and (4) 16°C and 690 ppm CO 2 ('greenhouse'). Nutrient availability in all treatments was designed to reproduce the low silicate conditions typical of this late stage of the bloom. Both elevated pCO2 and temperature resulted in changes in phytoplankton community structure. Increased temperature promoted whole community photosynthesis and particulate organic carbon (POC) production rates per unit chlorophyll a. Despite much higher coccolithophore abundance in the greenhouse treatment, particulate inorganic carbon production (calcification) was significantly decreased by the combination of increased pCO2 and temperature. Our experiments suggest that future trends during the bloom could include greatly reduced export of calcium carbonate relative to POC, thus providing a potential negative feedback to atmospheric CO2 concentration. Other trends with potential climate feedback effects include decreased community biogenic silica to POC ratios at higher temperature. These shipboard experiments suggest the need to examine whether future pCO2 and temperature increases on longer decadal timescales will similarly alter the biological and biogeochemical dynamics of the North Atlantic spring bloom. © Inter-Research 2009.",10.3354/meps08133,off-shore/fully marine,NA,57.988611,-15.533333,No,No,2005-06-20,2005-07-14,,2.7,Indoor,No,6,NP,,No,,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,Not specified,Yes,No,NA,NA,No,No,Yes,No,No,4,4,NA,NA,16,25,NA,NA,12,12,,,No fluctuations,CO2,CO2 exposure: 390ppm and 690ppm,"chl-a, group abundance/biomass, species abundance, trait, stoichiometry, Other: ecosystem (productivity)",,"Total chl-a, micro and nano-phytoplankton chl-a, picophytoplankton chl-a,  ratios of two different species in each treatment, abundance of major phytoplankton groups, concetration of haplophyte pigment, Biologically available Silica:POC molar ratio, POC: PIC molar ratio",,

Climate change stressors, including warming and heatwaves, can alter plankton composition and dominance patterns in temperate shallow lakes, which can disrupt ecosystem function and curtail ecosystem services. Understanding how these alterations could take place under future climates is therefore important. 2. To understand such changes, we performed a year-long mesocosm experiment with controls reflecting present temperature conditions and a treatment reflecting a future climate change scenario, including heatwaves of 5-8 degrees C above ambient water temperatures. 3. In the warmer conditions, the predatory invertebrate Mesostoma, exerted a strong top-down control on Daphnia, resulting in a switch in herbivore dominance to Ceriodaphnia in contrast to the controls where Daphnia remained dominant. A complementary predation experiment revealed that Mesostoma fed at a higher rate on Daphnia than on Ceriodaphnia and cyclopoid copepods. Cyclopoids were the least affected taxon but showed tendencies to sustain populations longer into the winter at elevated temperatures. Moreover, both total algal and cyanobacteria biomass increased with warming. 4. Our experiments suggest that predator-prey dynamics may alter plankton community composition and dominance patterns in a warmer climate because thermophilic predatory invertebrates have the potential to induce cascading food-chain effects and alter the herbivore dominance patterns in lake zooplankton.

Microcosms were constructed outdoors and monitored over time. The temperature was manipulated to simulate different scenarios predicted for the future. Warming caused a reduction in dissolved oxygen, while the pH and conductivity remained unchanged. We found a joint effect of temperature and time on chlorophyll-a as well as on the species and functional groups. The substitution of species and groups occurred in a similar way between treatments. However, a greater number of Cyanophyceae individuals were found at higher temperatures, while Bacillariophyceae and Euglenophyceae species were found more commonly in the lower warming treatments. These results indicate that warming altered the taxonomic and functional composition of phytoplankton, causing species substitution as well as a change in their functional characteristics, which led to the predominance of small organisms.

Thus, investigating the effects of global warming on these organisms is highly relevant, especially given the numerous climatic changes expected by the end of the century. In this study, we used an experimental approach and high-throughput sequencing to evaluate the shortterm effect of warming predicted by different future scenarios in the composition of the planktonic freshwater bacteria and microeukaryotes, and to verify if the same effects occur for each trophic level separately (autotrophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic). Our experiment demonstrated that the composition for eukaryotes and prokaryotes based on DNA metabarcoding is affected by the increase in temperature and these have a similar pattern of response to warming. This highlights the temperature importance in structuring the communities of different groups. Modifications in the communities were observed through the substitution of specific taxa, which occurred mainly in warmer levels. Changes in community composition were also identified when trophic levels were assessed separately. Mixotrophic eukaryotes organisms are more sensitive to warming, modifying the patterns of composition with an increase in temperature of 2 degrees C. Microeukaryotes and heterotrophic bacteria were more resistant, with alterations in the communities composition visualized only in higher warming levels. The composition of autotrophic organisms was not affected by the increase in water temperature in any of the biological classifications evaluated, although the richness of eukaryotic autotrophic has decreased with warming.

We hypothesized that the effect of thermal variability on boreal plankton depends on dissolved terrigenic matter (i.e., temperature-terrigenic interaction). A two-factor mesocosm (1500-L capacity) experiment consisting of three terrigenic treatment levels (control, [-] runoff, [+] runoff) and three temperature treatment levels (control, warm, and cold) was conducted in triplicate for a total of 27 mesocosms deployed in Lake 302S of the Experimental Lakes Area in Canada. The warming treatment amplified the positive effect of terrigenic amendment on total phytoplankton biomass by stimulating large (>35-mu m Greatest Axial Linear Dimension; GALD) taxa during the 50-d experiment. In comparison, removal of terrigenic matter increased the abundance of smaller (<35-mu m GALD) phytoplankton along with copepods and cladocerans under cold and warm conditions, respectively.

Although significant effects from temperature were observed during the entire experimental period, many were rather moderate and probably a combination of both direct and indirect effects. With the exception of an earlier development of floating microalgal mats at raised temperature, dividing the autotrophic compartment into a benthic and pelagic part, autotrophic variables, such as oxygen production, biomass, and species composition of benthic microalgae did not respond to warming. However, uptake of nutrients did increase, strengthening the role of shallow-water sediments as sinks for inorganic nutrients in spring. As hypothesized, heterotrophic variables (bacterial production, meiofaunal biomass, and dark fluxes of oxygen and total alkalinity) responded more clearly to warming than did autotrophic variables. Warming is generally hypothesized to push ecosystems towards heterotrophy, but there was no support for this in the present study. Although community respiration and anaerobic mineralization increased, the system remained highly autotrophic during the entire experiment due to the photosynthetic activity of benthic microalgae. The presence of a well-developed benthic microalgal community, already in early spring, appeared to moderate the temperature response.

Three zooplankton densities (1.5, 4 and 10 copepods l(-1)) and 2 temperature levels (Delta 0 degrees C and Delta 6 degrees C; 0 degrees C and 6 degrees C above present-day temperatures in the Kiel Bight) were chosen. Both the timing and the duration of the protozooplankton (PZP) bloom were significantly affected by temperature, but not by copepod density. In contrast, the bloom intensity of PZP was highly affected by the factors temperature and copepod density and their interaction. This suggests that under elevated temperature conditions PZP grows faster, but, at the same time, is subject to higher top-down control by copepods. At low temperatures and low copepod densities, PZP, in turn, fully escaped from copepod predation. Further changes in copepod overwintering densities resulted in a strong suppression of ciliates, of which small-sized ciliates (< 30 mu m) were especially vulnerable to copepod predation, while other PZP size classes remained unaffected. In conclusion, results point at a pivotal regulating role of overwintering copepods under future warming conditions. Further, warming was shown to cause a distinct match between phytoplankton and PZP, thus strengthening trophic pathways through PZP.

This is because temperature enhances phytoplankton growth while grazing is suggested to be reduced during such bottom-up controlled situations. In addition, enhanced CO2 concentrations potentially favor phytoplankton species, that otherwise depend on costly carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCM). The trophic consequences for consumers under such conditions, however, remain little understood. We set out to experimentally explore the combined effects of increasing temperature and CO2 concentration for phytoplankton biomass and stoichiometry and the consequences for trophic transfer (here for copepods) on a natural nutrient limited Baltic Sea summer plankton community. The results show, that warming effects were translated to the next trophic level by switching the system from a bottom-up controlled to a mainly top-down controlled one. This was reflected in significantly down-grazed phytoplankton and increased zooplankton abundance in the warm temperature treatment (22.5 degrees C). Additionally, at low temperature (16.5 degrees C) rising CO2 concentrations significantly increased phytoplankton biomass. The latter effect however, was due to direct negative impact of CO2 on copepod nauplii which released phytoplankton from grazing in the cold but not in the warm treatments.

We previously observed a long-term increase in the compositional variability of phytoplankton in a large shallow lake with a concurrent rise in mean temperature, and we conducted an experimental test of this hypothetical link in a mesocosm system. Following predictions of water temperature for the end of the century, 12 mesocosms were filled with prefiltered and sterilized lake water with six of the tanks kept 3 degrees C above ambient levels. Phytoplankton colonization and subsequent changes in its composition were monitored using microscopic analysis and flow cytometry. Chlorophytes were the most successful colonizers, with no treatment-specific effect on dominant taxa. However, heated mesocosms showed higher variation in community structure (distance-based beta diversity), due to higher variability in subdominant species, a considerable portion of which were flagellated taxa.

Thousands of lakes in the Northern Hemisphere are experiencing a continuous increase in water temperature and colour. While increasing temperature is an effect of climate change, several factors are suggested to drive the increasing water colour, including climate change, altered land use and reversed acidification. 2. In this mesocosm study, we study the effects on pelagic production and sedimentation of organic carbon from a 3 degrees C increase in temperature, a doubling of water colour and a combination of increased temperature and water colour. These manipulations correspond to the predicted development in water colour and temperature in northern temperate systems within the life time of the next generation. 3. The water and plankton communities in the mesocosms were taken from an oligohumic and mesotrophic lake, and the increase in water colour was achieved by the additions of water from a humic lake. The experiment ran from early March to late October. 4. In accordance with our predictions and previous cross-system analyses, net carbon production (NCP) and organic carbon sedimentation decreased in response to increasing water colour. 5. At odds with current theory, NCP and sedimentation increased in heated treatments, as not only respiration but also gross production increased in response to temperature. There were no synergistic effects between warming and browning. 6. These results imply that warming may enhance pelagic delivery of organic carbon to sediments.

The treatments were set up to feature ambient conditions (28 degrees C, 35 PSU), hyposalinity (31 PSU), warming (31 degrees C), and a double manipulation treatment with warming and hyposalinity (31 degrees C, 31 PSU). The hyposaline treatment had the most considerable influence, manifested as significantly lower primary production, and the most dissimilar micro-phytoplankton species community. The increased temperature acted as a catalyst in the double manipulation treatment, and higher primary production was maintained. We investigated the dynamics of the microbial community with a structural equation model and found a significant interrelationship between phytoplankton biomass and bacterial abundance. Using this methodology, it became evident that temperature and salinity changes, individually and together, mediate direct and indirect effects that influence different compartments of the microbial loop.

However, the impacts of different drivers on stoichiometric (carbon, C; nitrogen, N; and phosphorus, P) variations of organisms have not been well addressed. In order to understand how stoichiometric traits vary across trophic levels under different environmental stressors, we performed a mesocosm experiment to explore the impacts of warming (including +3 °C consistent warming above ambient and heat waves ranging from 0 to 6 °C), eutrophication, herbicide and their interactions on stoichiometric traits of organisms at different trophic levels, which was quantified by stable nitrogen isotopes. Results showed that herbicide treatment had no significant impacts on all stochiometric traits, while warming and eutrophication significantly affected the stoichiometric traits of organisms at lower trophic levels. Eutrophication increased nutrient contents and decreased C: nutrient ratios in primary producers, while the response of N:P ratios depended on the taxonomic group. The contribution of temperature treatments to stoichiometric variation was less than that of eutrophication. Heat waves counteracted the impacts of eutrophication, which was different from the effects of continuous warming, indicating that eutrophication impacts on organism stoichiometric traits depended on climate scenarios. Compared to environmental drivers, taxonomic group was the dominant driver that determined the variations of stoichiometric traits. Furthermore, the stoichiometric stability of organisms was strongly positively correlated with their trophic levels.

Consequently, changes at the base of the food web favoring heterotrophic bacteria over phytoplankton are expected, affecting the food web structure. We tested this hypothesis using an outdoor shallow mesocosm system in the northern Baltic Sea in early summer, where the effects of increased temperature (+ 3°C) and terrestrial matter inputs were studied following the system dynamics and conducting grazing experiments. Juvenile perch constituted the highest trophic level in the system, which exerted strong predation on the zooplankton community. Perch subsequently released the microbial food web from heavy grazing by mesozooplankton. Addition of terrestrial matter had a stronger effect on the microbial food web than the temperature increase, because terrestrial organic matter and accompanying nutrients promoted both heterotrophic bacterial production and phytoplankton primary production. Moreover, due to the shallow water column in the experiment, terrestrial matter addition did not reduce the light below the photosynthesis saturation level, and in these conditions, the net-autotrophy was strengthened by terrestrial matter enrichment. In combination with elevated temperature, the terrestrial matter addition effects were intensified, further shifting the size distribution of the microbial food web base from picoplankton to microphytoplankton. These changes up the food web led to increase in the biomass and proportion of large-sized ciliates (>60 µm) and rotifers. Despite the shifts in the microbial food web size structure, grazing experiments suggested that the pathway from picoplankton to nano- and microzooplankton constituted the major energy flow in all treatments. The study implies that the microbial food web compartments in shallow coastal waters will adjust to climate induced increased inputs of terrestrial matter and elevated temperature, and that the major energy path will flow from picoplankton to large-sized ciliates during the summer period.

The warming effect on the timing of the spring phytoplankton peak varied with the FCL. Warming led to the disappearance of the phytoplankton peak in the 2-level systems but resulted in an extensive, delayed phytoplankton peak in the 3-level systems. Irrespective of the FCL, warming did not significantly advance the timing of the Daphnia peak, although Daphnia recruited earlier under warm conditions. Both warming and FCL significantly reduced the size of the Daphnia peak.

Despite the key relevance of phytoplankton and periphyton in freshwaters, the combined and potential synergistic effects of fish omnivory, warming and eutrophication, especially on periphyton, remains little addressed, particularly for subtropical shallow lakes. We experimentally tested the food web effects on phytoplankton and periphyton induced by small visually feeding omnivorous fish (Rhodeus ocellatus), high nutrient enrichment and warming (+4.5 °C) in thirty-two 1000 L-mesocosms simulating littoral conditions of subtropical shallow lakes. We aimed at analysing the mechanisms and responses of periphyton and phytoplankton to these experimental factors. All mesocosms included the submerged macrophytes Vallisneria denseserrulata and Potamogeton lucens and artificial plants at 50% plant volume inhabited, plankton and macroinvertebrates. Small-sized visually feeding omnivorous fish enhanced phytoplankton dominance and periphyton loss. These changes coincided with a decrease in zooplankton biomass and a diversity loss of both zooplankton and macroinvertebrates as well as an increase in snail abundance. Fish presence led to a collapse of cladocerans, thereby releasing the grazing pressure on phytoplankton, and predator and collector macroinvertebrates were replaced with small snails (Radix peregra < 0.5 cm) resulting in enhanced grazing on periphyton. Eutrophication reinforced the fish effects, while warming had weak or no effects.

The response of ectotherms to changes in temperature depends not only on their species-specific thermal tolerances but also on temperature-mediated interactions across different trophic levels. Warming is predicted to reinforce trophic cascades in linear aquatic food chains, but little is known about how warming might affect the lower trophic levels of food webs involving extensive fish omnivory, a common scenario in subtropical and tropical waterbodies. In this study, a mesocosm warming experiment was conducted involving a pelagic food chain (fish–zooplankton–phytoplankton) topped by the omnivorous bighead carp [Aristichthys nobilis (Richardson)]. We found that temperature elevation significantly enhanced the growth of fish and suppressed zooplankton, including both metazooplankton and ciliates, while abundances of phytoplankton, despite disruption of temporal dynamics, did not increase correspondingly—likely due to fish predation. Our results suggest that trophic cascades are less unlikely to be reinforced by warming in food chains involving significant omnivory. Moreover, we found that warming advanced the spring abundance peak of phytoplankton abundance and that of the parthenogenetic rotifer Brachionus quadridentatus; whereas, it had no effect on the only sexually reproducing copepod, Mesocyclops leuckarti, presumably due to its prolonged life history. Our study also confirmed that warming may lead to a phenological mismatch between some predators and their prey because of the distinct life histories among taxa, with potentially severe consequences for resource flow in the food chain, at least in the short term. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s00442-020-04758-x,shallow lake/pond,China,31.430000,120.193333,Not specified,No,2018-03-30,2018-06-29,,370,Outdoor,No,6,eutrophic,,Yes,1.85 mg P and 48.1 μg N daily,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Not specified,No,Not specified,No,Yes,NP,NE,Not provided,Not provided,Yes,Not applicable,Not applicable,3,3,7,NP,31,NE,NA,NA,NE,NE,,,Natural fluctuations were minimized by using a water bath,NA,NA,"Chl-a, Species biomass/abundance",,"Spectrophotometer based chl-a measurement, cell size based biomass",,

Nonetheless, the effect of warming on primary producers is poorly understood, especially periphyton production, which is affected both directly and indirectly by temperature-sensitive top-down and bottom-up controls. Here, we study the impact of warming on gross primary production in experimental ecosystems with near-realistic foodwebs during spring and early summer. We used indoor mesocosms following a temperate temperature regime (control) and a warmed (+4 °C) treatment to measure biomass and production of phytoplankton and periphyton. The mesocosms' primary production was dominated by periphyton (>82%) during the studied period (April-June). Until May, periphyton production and biomass were significantly higher in the warm treatment (up to 98% greater biomass compared to the control) due to direct temperature effects on growth and indirect effects resulting from higher sediment phosphorus release. Subsequently, enhanced grazer abundances seem to have counteracted the positive temperature effect causing a decline in periphyton biomass and production in June. We thus show, within our studied period, seasonally distinct effects of warming on periphyton, which can significantly affect overall ecosystem primary production and functioning. © 2018 The Author(s).",10.1038/s41598-018-26348-x,shallow lake,Netherlands,51.98245,5.726280,Yes,No,2014-03-03,2014-06-30,,908,Indoor,Not specified,4,meso-eutrophic,,Yes,"NO₃: 86 ± 19 µM, PO₄: 2.4 ± 0.8 µM, Si: 152 ± 37 µM",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Not specified,Yes,Not specified,Yes,No,NP,NA,Not provided,Not provided,Yes,Not applicable,Not applicable,4,4,NP,NP,21.3,NE,NA,NA,NE,NE,,,natural fluctutaion in lake,NA,NA,"chl-a, biomass, community and elemental composition",,"chl-a, biomass, community and elemental composition",,

The Arctic Ocean is the region of the world experiencing climate change at the steepest rate compared with other latitudes. Since marine planktonic microorganisms play a key role in the biogeochemical cycles in the ocean it is crucial to simultaneously evaluate the effect of warming and increasing CO2 on marine microbial communities. In 20 L experimental microcosms filled with water from a high-Arctic fjord (Svalbard), we examined changes in phototrophic and heterotrophic microbial abundances and processes [bacterial production (BP) and mortality], and viral activity (lytic and lysogenic) in relation to warming and elevated CO2. The summer microbial plankton community living at 1.4°C in situ temperature, was exposed to increased CO2 concentrations (135-2,318 μatm) in three controlled temperature treatments (1, 6, and 10°C) at the UNIS installations in Longyearbyen (Svalbard), in summer 2010. Results showed that chlorophyll a concentration decreased at increasing temperatures, while BP significantly increased with pCO2 at 6 and 10°C. Lytic viral production was not affected by changes in pCO2 and temperature, while lysogeny increased significantly at increasing levels of pCO2, especially at 10°C (R2 = 0.858, p = 0.02). Moreover, protistan grazing rates showed a positive interaction between pCO2 and temperature. The averaged percentage of bacteria grazed per day was higher (19.56 ± 2.77% d-1) than the averaged percentage of lysed bacteria by virus (7.18 ± 1.50% d-1) for all treatments. Furthermore, the relationship among microbial abundances and processes showed that BP was significantly related to phototrophic pico/nanoflagellate abundance in the 1°C and the 6°C treatments, and BP triggered viral activity, mainly lysogeny at 6 and 10°C, while bacterial mortality rates was significantly related to bacterial abundances at 6°C. Consequently, our experimental results suggested that future increases in water temperature and pCO2 in Arctic waters will produce a decrease of phytoplankton biomass, enhancement of BP and changes in the carbon fluxes within the microbial food web. All these heterotrophic processes will contribute to weakening the CO2 sink capacity of the Arctic plankton community. © 2019 Vaqué, Lara, Arrieta, Holding, Sà, Hendriks, Coello-Camba, Alvarez, Agustí, Wassmann and Duarte.",10.3389/fmicb.2019.00494,"coastal (fjord, bay)",Norway,78.082600,13.473400,No,No,2010-06-23,2010-07-06,,20,Not specified,Not specified,6,NP,,Not specified,NA,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,Not specified,Yes,No,NP,NA,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Not applicable,1.8; 6.7; 10.3,"1.8, 6.7, 10.3",NP,1,10.4,13,NA,NA,4.5,NP,,,Controlled without fluctuations,CO2,CO2 enrichment,"Chl-a, abundance",,Chlorophyll-a concentration and phototrophic pico/nanoflagellate abundances,,

To assess whether and how community structures of phytoplankton and nitrogen uptake respond to the combined effects of elevated temperature and eutrophication, we performed a mesocosm experiment in field by combining a 4.5 °C increase in temperature and the addition of phosphorus. Our results demonstrated that the combination of rising temperatures and phosphorus loading stimulated the maximum biomass built up by the phytoplankton community, and changed the phytoplankton community by significantly increasing the number of Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta, and decreasing that of Cryptophyta. We also examined the effects of climate warming and eutrophication on phytoplankton nitrogen uptake and dynamics using 15N tracer techniques. The addition of phosphorus slightly increased the phytoplankton nitrate uptake velocity and relative preference index, but decreased the nitrate uptake turnover time. Warming relatively increased the ammonium uptake velocity and the relative preference index, but decreased the ammonium turnover time. In kinetic studies, NH4  + exhibited a higher maximum uptake rate (Vmax) and a lower half-saturation constant (Ks) than NO3  - substrates due to temperature elevation and the addition of phosphorus. Hence, warming and eutrophication increased the capacity of phytoplankton for NH4  + uptake and their affinity at low substrate concentrations. Thus, the combined effects of climate warming and phosphorus nutrient availability may increase the prevalence of Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta, and change the nitrogen cycling of aquatic ecosystems. © 2018 by the authors.",10.3390/w10081057,shallow lake,China,30.184167,114.633056,No,No,2014-07-01,2014-08-31,,~1763,Outdoor,Not specified,6,mesotrophic,,Yes,"50 µg L−1 phosphate (KH2PO4) every 2 weeks,",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Not specified,No,Yes,No,Yes,NP,NE,No,Not applicable,Yes,Not applicable,Not applicable,4.5,4.5,NA,NE,37.9,NE,NA,NA,NE,NE,,,natural fluctuations matching the lake,nutrients,Nutrients,"Chl-a, abundance, physiological rate",,"cell count, relative proportions of different taxa, nitrate and ammonium uptake by phytoplankton",,

Ongoing climatic shifts and increased pollution pressure have created the need to assess potential effects and interactions of physical and biotic factors on coastal ecosystem processes to project ecosystem resilience and persistence. In coastal marine environments, primary production dynamics are driven by the interaction between bottom-up abiotic effects and biotic effects induced by top-down trophic control. Given the many environmental and climatic changes observed throughout coastal regions, we assessed the effects of interactions among temperature, nutrients and grazing in a laboratory-based microcosm experiment. We did this by comparing chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations at two temperatures in combination with four nutrient regimes. To test for subsequent cascading effects on higher trophic levels, we also measured grazing and growth rates of the calanoid copepod Pseudodiaptomus hessei. We observed different phytoplankton and zooplankton responses to temperature (17 °C, 24 °C) and nutrients (nitrogen only (N), phosphates only (P), nitrogen and phosphates combined (NP), no nutrient additions (C)). Contributions of predictors to model fit in the boosted regression trees model were phosphates (42.7%), copepods (23.8%), nitrates (17.5%) and temperature (15.9%), suggesting phosphates were an important driver for the high chl-a concentrations observed. There was an increase in total phytoplankton biomass across both temperatures, while nutrient addition affected the phytoplankton size structure prior to grazing irrespective of temperature. Phytoplankton biomass was highest in the NP treatment followed by the N treatment. However, the phytoplankton size structure differed between temperatures, with microphytoplankton being dominant at 24 °C, while nanophytoplankton dominated at 17 °C. The P and C treatments exhibited the lowest phytoplankton biomass. Copepod abundances and growth rates were higher at 17 °C than at 24 °C. This study highlights that bottom-up positive effects in one trophic level do not always positively cascade into another trophic level. It was, however, evident that temperature was a limiting factor for plankton abundance, productivity and size structure only when nutrients were limiting, with top-down pressure exhibiting minimal effects on the phytoplankton. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.09.132,"coastal (fjord, bay)",South Africa,-33.582167,26.861611,Not specified,No,NP,NP ,,2,Not specified,Not specified,6,NP,,Yes,nitrate (N) and phosphate (P) working stock solutions used in the microcosms had concentrations of 10 μM and 15 μM. 1 mL of these were added every 48 hours,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,Not specified,Yes,No,NP,NA,Yes,Yes,Yes,Not applicable,Not applicable,7,7,0,0,24,35,NA,NA,NP,NP,,,12:12 light and dark,nutrients,Nutrients,"chlorophyll-a, biomass and size structure",,"chlorophyll-a, biomass and size structure",duration not specified (35 days),

Copepods are the most prominent zooplankton group, and elevated temperature increases their growth and grazing rates. So far, it is unknown to what extent copepods affect the partitioning and stoichiometry of organic matter in a warmer surface ocean. We therefore conducted a mesocosm experiment with 3 copepod densities and 2 temperature scenarios to determine effects on the pools of dissolved and particulate organic matter and their C:N:P ratios. Here we show that particulate organic C (POC) concentrations decreased with increasing copepod abundance. This effect was more pronounced at elevated temperature, yielding a decrease in the POC to particulate nitrogen ratio (POC:PN) from 26 to 13 and in the POC:particulate organic phosphorus (POP) ratio from 567 to 257, from low to high copepod density. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) accumulation was positively affected by temperature. However, increasing copepod abundance decreased the accumulation of DOC at elevated temperature. Copepod grazing and egestion enhanced the recycling of N and P, thereby increasing the availability of these nutrients for autotrophs. In concert with temperature-induced shifts in the phytoplankton community composition and size, changes in copepod abundance may therefore have contributed to altering the elemental composition of seston. Our findings suggest combined effects of zooplankton grazing and temperature on the composition and recycling of organic matter that should be taken into account when simulating biogeochemical cycles in a future ocean. © The authors 2015.",10.3354/meps11148,"coastal (fjord, bay)",Germany,54.328583,10.179750,No,No,2009-01-08,2009-02-16,,1400,Indoor,Not specified,3,oligo-mesotrophic,,Not specified,"Initial nutrient concentrations (Day 1) were 14.3 ± 0.22 µmol l−1 nitrate, 0.81 ± 0.01 µmol l−1 nitrite, 2.56 ± 0.12 µmol l−1 ammonium, 0.93 ± 0.04 µmol l−1 phosphate and 30.3 ± 0.7 µmol l−1 silicate.",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,Not specified,Yes,No,NP,NA,Yes,Yes,Yes,Not applicable,Not applicable,6,6,1,2,8.2,39,NA,NA,3.5,NP,,,Natural fluctuations with day-night cycle,grazing,Copepod density,"chlorophyll-a, species biomass/abundance, community metrics,",,"chlorophyll-a concentration as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass,  stoichiometry of organic matter and effect on the relative abundance of different phytoplankton groups",,

We present a fully-crossed factorial mesocosm study and assess how warming and acidification affect the abundance, body size, and fatty acid composition of copepods as a measure of nutritional quality. The experimental set-up allowed us to determine whether the effects of warming and acidification act additively, synergistically, or antagonistically on the abundance, body size, and fatty acid content of copepods, a major group of lower level consumers in marine food webs. Copepodite (developmental stages 1-5) and nauplii abundance were antagonistically affected by warming and acidification. Higher temperature decreased copepodite and nauplii abundance, while acidification partially compensated for the temperature effect. The abundance of adult copepods was negatively affected by warming. The prosome length of copepods was significantly reduced by warming, and the interaction of warming and CO2 antagonistically affected prosome length. Fatty acid composition was also significantly affected by warming. The content of saturated fatty acids increased, and the ratios of the polyunsaturated essential fatty acids docosahexaenoic-(DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) to total fatty acid content increased with higher temperatures. Additionally, here was a significant additive interaction effect of both parameters on arachidonic acid. Our results indicate that in a future ocean scenario, acidification might partially counteract some observed effects of increased temperature on zooplankton, while adding to others. These may be results of a fertilizing effect on phytoplankton as a copepod food source. In summary, copepod populations will be more strongly affected by warming rather than by acidifying oceans, but ocean acidification effects can modify some temperature impacts. © 2016 Garzke et al.

We tested the impact of elevated temperature on the top-down and bottom-up forces structuring experimental freshwater pond food webs in western Canada over 16 months. Experimental warming was crossed with treatments manipulating the presence of planktivorous fish and eutrophication through enhanced nutrient supply. We found that higher temperatures produced top-heavy food webs with lower biomass of benthic and pelagic producers, equivalent biomass of zooplankton, zoo-benthos and pelagic bacteria, and more pelagic viruses. Eutrophication increased the biomass of all organisms studied, while fish had cascading positive effects on periphyton, phytoplankton and bacteria, and reduced biomass of invertebrates. Surprisingly, virus biomass was reduced in the presence of fish, suggesting the possibility for complex mechanisms of top-down control of the lytic cycle. Warming reduced the effects of eutrophication on periphyton, and magnified the already strong effects of fish on phytoplankton and bacteria. Warming, fish and nutrients all increased whole-system rates of net production despite their distinct impacts on the distribution of biomass between producers and consumers, plankton and benthos, and microbes and macrobes.

The temperature was varied from 5 to 20°C in each experiment, running over a 3-week period. The experiments included food webs of at least four trophic levels: (1) phytoplankton-bacteria, (2) flagellates, (3) ciliates and (4) metazooplankton. The results showed that heterotrophic to autotrophic biomass ratio (H/A) increased 5 times when temperature was raised from 5 to 10°C. In agreement, the carbon fixation to respiration ratio indicated a decrease of six times over the same temperature range. Furthermore, the sedimentation decreased by 45% when the temperature was elevated from 5 to 10°C, probably as a consequence of the increased respiration losses and bacterial biodegradation of settling material. Analyzed parameters, thus, indicated that the degree of heterotrophy increased in the temperature interval of 5-10°C. Above 10°C, the analyzed parameters in general were more stable. Our results indicate that moderately elevated seawater temperatures, due to climate change or weather alterations, may affect the entire ecosystem function in temperate sea areas by altering the balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy. © Springer 2005.",10.1007/s10750-005-2742-4,sea,Sweden,63.516700,19.801900,Yes,No,2001-02-14,2001-04-07,,900,Indoor,Not specified,3,NP,,Yes,"0.5 μM nitrate, 0.9 μM ammonia, 0.04 μM phosphate added twice a week",Yes,Yes,No,Not specified,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,NP,NA,Not provided,Yes,Yes,Not applicable,Not applicable, 5; 10; 15; 20," 5, 10, 15, 20",0,0," 5, 10, 15, 20",divided in 3 parts- each for 3 weeks,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,Controlled without fluctuations,NA,NA,"Chlorophyll-a, Species biomass/abundance, Group biomass/abundance",,"Chl a, phytoplankton biomass and abundance, cyanobacteria biomass, diatom biomass, ",,

We examined the relative effects of iron addition (+1 nM) and increased temperature (+4&deg;C) on plankton assemblages of the Ross Sea, Antarctica, a region characterized by annual algal blooms and an active microbial community. Increased iron and temperature individually had consistently significant but relatively minor positive effects on total phytoplankton abundance, phytoplankton and microzooplankton community composition, as well as photosynthetic parameters and nutrient drawdown. Unexpectedly, increased iron had a consistently negative impact on microzooplankton abundance, most likely a secondary response to changes in phytoplankton community composition. When iron and temperature were increased in concert, the resulting interactive effects were greatly magnified. This synergy between iron and temperature increases would not have been predictable by examining the effects of each variable individually.
